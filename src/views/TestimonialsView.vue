        Prasenjit is the definition of multi-talented. A medical doctor, DJ, and software developer.
        All very impressive traits. I worked with Prasenjit for over a year and a half where he
        oversaw the development of a nation-wide pool artists, curating for top talent and
        potential. He was organized, timely, professional, and smart. I would recommend him for any
        team.

        It's my pleasure to offer my recommendation for Prasenjit Das. Over the last several years,
        Prasenjit has always demonstrated great workmanship and great spirits when working together
        in the studio. He's also a person that you can learn from and that's the kind of person you
        want on your team. Prasenjit is an asset to any team, organization, you name it. He has a
        strong passion for the music industry and his skillset outputs the right amount of soul that
        will entice anyone to get close to him.

        I have no doubt in my mind that if you need any sort of helping hand, guide, or knowledge on
        any given topics. Mr. Prasenjit Das (Prasun) is the man you need to help excel and refine
        your skills, improve quality of understanding in any topic, provide efficiency in any
        project or business, and if you need an event with amazing music and unique stage presence;
        Prasun is your man. Prasun's foundational training, knowledge, and work ethic comes from
        achieving his Medical Doctorate but he is much more than a Doctor. Prasun has abundant
        knowledge in process automation, event management, excelling small business' and projects,
        composing music, ghost writing for musicians and performers and dedicates his free time
        doing live music performances all around Canada. I have known Prasun well over 15 years and
        I would recommend him, with the highest regard, to be on your team in whatever endeavours
        you have. Apart from being self-motivated, dedicated, disciplined, and highly knowledgable
        in business, music, and health. This man's work ethic is unwavering and unmatched. He's the
        type of person you want on your side in any challenge because of his apt genius and sheer
        disciplined work ethic. Prasun is able to react quickly and deliver goals in any given
        circumstance. He is resourceful, approachable, and is always willing to listen and achieve
        the best possible outcome. He is the type of individual that shows you that failures are
        indeed just more steps to one's success. Furthermore, Prasun is always able to achieve any
        set goal with efficiency and quality. Prasenjit Das is guided by his strict determination,
        disciplined hustle, and overarching sense of empathy and compassion within his work ethic.
        He brings to one's attention the value of hard work and this has served him well in many
        environments. Beyond his angst, solid discipline, and genius aptitude, I am honoured to call
        Prasun my friend and colleague.

        It is fair to say that Prasenjit Das is not only a highly intuitive musician, composer and
        accomplished pianist, but his musical talents and incredibly unique performance ability
        within the live arena and in studios can light up even the most near complete projects and
        compositional ideas. This young man knows no bounds and the very creativity by which he
        lives, eats, sleeps and breathes is simply formidable and a real thing of beauty to behold.
        This incredibly gifted, young, musical professional is a very rare find in today's world
        make no mistake and a genuine diamond in the rough like he surely is can add enormous
        sparkle and class to any composition or live works set before him and the great thing is the
        ease and speed by which he delivers and the level at which he operates. Undeniably he is a
        future star in the making with a mind that works at break neck speed with a creative
        overdrive to rival some of the very best in the business; Prasenjit Das should be the go to
        guy for all things compositional or live performance based, because there really is no finer
        specimen for the job.

        I have worked with Prasenjit on several events over the course of the years that we've known
        each other. From small, one night events for 50 people, to a multi-day music festival with
        over 40 change-overs, Prasun Das, as both a musician and a technical director is one of the
        most passionate, committed individuals I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Prasun is
        a technical, funky keyboardist, an astute sound technician, and his level of professionalism
        meshes with the soundscapes to transform audiences. Truly a visionary.
