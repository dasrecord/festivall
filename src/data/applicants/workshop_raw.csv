17/12/2014 20:01:16,Lucy Lambert,6047160916,lubert@hotmailcouk,"Hey! I am a Yogini and Yoga Teacher with many practices I'd love to share at this beautiful festival! I can offer a variety of yoga sessions as listed below, let me know which ones you are interested in!

Yin Yoga Sessions - 
One of the styles of yoga I teach and love is yin yoga Yin Yoga is a deeply meditative practice where poses are held for 3 - 5 minutes each in order to begin release of connective tissue I teach classes that focus on certain Meridians in the Chinese Medicine system which correspond to certain elements and organs Each one focuses on a different organ for example the Water Element class focuses on the Kidneys, Wood Element focuses on Liver, ect ect 
The classes are about an hour long and are juicy done in the evening by candlelight But they are lovely anytime of day! These classes can be a really sweet contribution to the festival vibe as they are deeply relaxing and give people an opportunity to come into harmony with themselves and the elements, while having a profound detoxifying effect on the organs

Cakra System Yoga Sessions
I also teach classes centered around the Cakra System These classes focus on different pranayama breathing exercises as well as kriyas energetic cleansing, mudras, and some physical movements and visualizations that charge up the different Cakras I either teach one class which starts at the root cakra and works its way up the Cakras to the top of the head, or I teach different classes which focus specifically on one Cakra the entire time These sessions often leave people feeling energized, clear, and connected to their spirits

Hatha and Vinyasa Flow Sessions -
I also love to teach Hatha flow and Vinyasa flow classes I weave mudras, pranayama and kriyas together with physical classes that range from vigorous Power Vinyasa to mellow Hatha flow These can be nice classes to do early in the day, to get people charged up for the rest of the festival

This is what I am willing to offer, any or all of it, depending on what the festival is interested in incorporating! If I can contribute any of those things above, let me know  

I'm happy to exchange these classes for a festival pass, but depending on the resources of the festival, if it's possible for me to receive payment, as a practicing yoga instructor of course I would apriciate that

Blessings!

Would love to lead an interactive workshop on transformational storytelling With experiential exercises and group discussion Rooted in the philosophy of yoga and the wisdom of transformation Exploring together a new vocabulary for sharing the inherent gifts in all of us

This is a workshop for anyone in the business of transformation - especially coaches, change-agents, and creatives Who want to more authentically build their platform of influence 

You see the future, full of exciting possibilities You're already making a difference in people's lives You just wish more folks understood the mojo of who you are, what you do, and how you roll 

This is a workshop on how to story yourself into being 

We'll explore your story of origin, and discover the untapped power of your story All based on the principles that character trumps credentials and presence trumps performance Storytelling is like fortune-telling Are you choosing the right story for the future you want to create?

Yoga is about the resolution of opposites About union and connection to source Storytelling is one of the deepest forms of yoga A way to access your inner-most knowing And express it to the world in a way that awakens the heart, resolves conflict, and makes things whole 

You already are a storyteller We all are Question is, do you know the stories you inhabit? Are you telling the right stories for the future you want to create? How do you get others to see what you see? 

Story is a verb That's where the magic of story resides In the conjugation of your life's experiences into wisdom Where you recognize the inherent choice in every moment to define the meaning and path forward When you change, the story has to change Because the stories you tell literally make the world 

Michael Margolis is a teacher, author, and entrepreneur He's the founder of Get Storied, the world's leading school for business storytelling He's also a healer and story shaman, trained in the science of subtle body awareness and the anatomy of the soul Michael is left-handed, color-blind, and eats more chocolate than the average human wwwgetstoriedcom

Depending on what your festival needs I have a couple of workshops I'd really like to share with others I have spoken to Kala about my circumstance of dates I will not be able to attend till the 22nd of the festival, and hope what I can offer will be helpful :


THE ART OF PERCEPTION EXPRESSION
This is a 3 hr creative expression/perception expansion workshop! Art supplies will be provided AND you get to take home your creations : will need to have a cap on how many people, preferably around 10-20, can attend as I'll need to get the right number of canvases for people to paint/use/take home

""This creative workshop are for those who simply want to express in a judgement-free way through art, all the while gaining new insights and perceptions on creative expression Often people feel that creativity is reserved for the arts, let me tell you it is absolutely not! : I think it is imperative to remember that the word creativity stems from the root word, ÄúCreateÄù Äì so a scientist who isnÄôt artistic, is creative when they create a new theory; or a mechanic is creative when they build a motor-run bicycle We are always creating in life So donÄôt be afraid to create whatever you imagine, this is what this space and workshop is for, to gain a new perspective on creative expression""

I created this workshop after my own plant medicine journey with mushrooms & painting and learned so much about the way we perceive expression, communicate our expression, limit our expression and most significantly - how our expression creates perceptions And so I want to share what I've learned, and hope that they too will leave with a new perception about expression It will be 3 hours of laughter, smiles, heart connections, new perspectives, full expressions and authentic selves

We will start with introductions as well as our intentions guided by an oracle card draw and an explanation on the purpose of this creative expression workshop, then we will spend a full hour creating freely through paint & mix-media and music I will go around and aid in bringing into consciousness the choices they are making with art, then the final hour will be for sharing and discussion on the different perspectives we receive from other's creations - then the creator will share their original intention

All that you need to bring with you are clothing that can get paint on it as youÄôll be painting/creating with hands, and come with a positive attitude, open heart & mind

The cost per person is $3000 original is $50, but with no tea/snacks - $30 This is negotiable as well though for your festival - this will cover the art supplies used as well as the one you take with you

_____________________________________

HEART EXPANSION: I AM TO WE ARE
This is a 15-2hr workshop - there does not have to be a charge for this workshop I would prefer to keep it down to a size of 10-14 people

It is based on the practice of Ho'oponopono, while understanding what oneness feels like on a very intimate and personal level

The purpose of this workshop is to break through the mental understanding/limitations of oneness - to not just simply say ""Namaste,"" ""We are one,"" ""I see you in me,"" etc without truly understanding how it feels to move from the ""I AM"" to ""WE ARE"" To bring this New Earth of wholeness & oneness into reality, the oneness must be tangible to our hearts and body as well

So we begin with an introduction/sharing circle of why we have wanted to participate and what we feel like oneness meansÄã; I will also speak briefly of seeing oneness in everythingÄã Then we will do a short guided meditation, to centre us and open our hearts to the journey we are about to embark on Then we will sit across another person we've never met before and move through the practice of Ho'oponopono ""Goodbye, I'm sorry - Please forgive me, Thank you, I love You""Äã After we will share again how our experiences were Rounding off with a group hug/circle where we place one hand on our hearts and one on the person's heart to the right of us Then end with a OM and Namaste!Äã

If you are short in healing practitioners I can also offer my Crystal Healing and/or Shamballa Reiki as well :

I hope that these options will fit with your festival! It would be great to also know what the processes is for the teachers if they are doing it in exchange for a ticket Ie how long, how many times, meals? etc

The synthesizer is an instrument that is central to electronic music In a synthesizer, electrical signals are generated and manipulated in a variety of ways These signals are eventually converted to sound when interpreted by a speaker system In this workshop, Sami will take you on a journey through audio synthesis We will learn about the different components of modern day synthesizers, and spend time getting lost in waves of sound

The Dream Catcher is a widely recognized symbol associated with the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island North America, attractive to many for its beautiful appearance and the promise of good dreams As awareness and concern of cultural appropriation continues to inform our increasingly globalized world, this is an opportune time to revisit the history, cultural context, and deep teachings of the Dream Catcher, which remain more relevant than ever in helping us relate to ourselves and each other from a place of gratitude and interconnectedness 

In this 25 hour teaching, participants will learn about the origin stories, history, and philosophical underpinning of the Dream Catcher while working together to create sacred space for the entire festival We will weave a Dream Catcher within a clearing, using surrounding trees as anchor points for the outer rim The resulting form will provide a space for mindful retreat over the course of the festival, sheltered by trees and blessed by the community spirit of workshop participants Therefore, it would be ideal for this teaching to run on the first day

15/07/2015 17:58:40,Chris Pisesky,2508596206,cpisesky@ualbertaca,"Hello beautiful people!
8 years ago I graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in honors genetics  At the time I was expected to begin medical school, but I was disillusioned and upset at the little attention that was paid to what we call the placebo  Furthermore, it was difficult to see how any real evidence could be found when the modern medical establishment knows so little about consciousness itself  During my last couple years of my 5 year degree, I could only find a few researchers who were genuinely tackling the problem, and found my higher level genetics professors stumped when I asked questions that reached into the holes at the foundations of modern biology and medical research  There are so many anomalies simply being ignored because they do not fit into the current medical paradigm of reality  These anomalies cause discomfort within the minds of these researchers and doctors, who choose to ignore the science and continue on as though nothing happened, but science is about the pursuit of truth no matter where it takes you
The last 8 years have led me to every corner of the planet to study with Yogis, Monks, Shamans of the amazon, and to unique and cutting edge research labs all over the States, Canada, and Europe  What I found is a growing body of evidence to show how powerful our minds are when it comes to the manifestation of a strong healthy body, and an increasing number of researchers tackling the question of the placebo in honest, open minded ways  What I also discovered was the huge body of evidence uncovered by physicists over the last 100 years  None of it was taught in any biology classes, which is why modern medical research hasn't the slightest clue about what consciousness really might be  These physicists were never looking for answers to the consciousness riddle, they were trying to uncover the basic workings of the universe, but as a by-product of their curiosity, they have shown us an incredible amount concerning the question of consciousness  Finally a couple years ago, the BBC documentary 'What is Reality' was the first mainstream documentary to attempt to explain to us that it is impossible to understand reality without understanding the role consciousness plays in its creation, and that you are now an outsider in the world of physics if you deny that consciousness has an effect on the physical universe  Nowhere is that more important than with our bodies  We cannot accept the placebo without accepting that the placebo is actually in effect 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that more than anything, our expectations and outlooks for our current and future state of health are what drives the wellness or sickness of our being
In order to complement my scientific understanding of what is happening between our mind and body, I have studied the mind through psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, NLP, the teachings of Buddhism, and I have trained to teach Yoga and meditation  This workshop is not only about sharing the framework of the new health paradigm coming from science, but to help with the understanding of what we can do to change the beliefs and paradigms we hold in our unconscious  Yoga is not simply a tool to maintain the fitness of the body, as is commonly believed in our western world, but it is a tool to help with mental stress and the creation of positivism  So many of us are stuck in habitual negative mental thought patterns, but there are so many ways to overcome this and take control of our own happiness  Happiness is something that comes from within, from our paradigms and beliefs about the world, and in actuality has nothing to do with outside circumstances, but to the way we react to those circumstances  Through this workshop I try to empower people with not only a framework of knowledge but with some basic tools like visualization meditations to help create this positive state of health  Even at the National Institute of Health, the medical 'old boys' institution in Washington DC, research is coming out weekly to show that we have the power to very specifically up-regulate hormone production or immune response in our bodies through visualization techniques, meditation, and specific yogic asanas 
For the last 2 years, I have been travelling through Australia  I am about to be purchasing a few hundred acres of land in the north okanagan with some friends to start a sustainable farming project with a permaculture and yoga school  Most of Australia, was actually about courses and wwoofing, but I was inspired by the festival scene there  I was enjoying festivals, but felt a desire to give back a little more to the experience  Some friends convinced me I should start hosting workshops, and over the past 2 years I have done over 20 workshops and the workshop has evolved with every experience
I have learned that the most effective way to share this understanding is to lead the workshop as a guided group discussion  I have the framework, the knowledge, and the depth of examples and experiences to share that I could speak for hours in front of a group, but with something so sensitive that every one of us has so much personal experience and perspective on, Ive found that encouraging as much discussion and sharing from the group is a far more effective way to get the point across  That being said, Ive learned several techniques which have helped me maintain order in a discussion that can bring up so many emotions
At the moment I am very busy starting a community futures small business program to help me avoid any mistakes with this big project, and searching for property  I am however happy to answer any questions you might have  I still dont have a website, although a friend is helping me slowly build one, and there is no formal presentation or powerpoint I can send you  
If you have a projector, it would help me get a few points across with short videos I have on my computer, but those are not necessary either  At the festivals in Australia, I was generally given an hour and half or two hours, although I spoke to several communities where the discussion  reached almost four hours  2 hours is more than enough though  Ive done the workshop on beaches, under festival tents, and in large rooms, so the location doesn't really matter, what matters most is the intimacy and a space where we can be uninterrupted for the time of the workshop  
I understand that this letter is coming a bit late, but there is no problem for me to join you guys if you have a bit of space you want filled up  The subject of the workshop is unique and has always excited people, and the main purpose I have in sharing is to empower people to understand the mind body connection so that they can live a healthy life  It has been 4 years since the last time I was sick, and this is something I am hoping to help others realize is possible
Thanks, and Im looking forward to hearing back from you

Over the years I've taken some of the concepts I've learned through the work with the horses and transmuted them into other offerings that can happen without the presence of the animals themselves One such offering is called 'Dreamride', a 15 hr somatic ceremony/workshop where participants explore Mary Oliver's famous question: ""Tell me, what it is you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?""

Dreamride is about dreaming and stalking our right wild lives; the ones where we can offer ourselves and our gifts as food to the world It harnesses the power and transformative potential of horse energy as we will ask for a herd of horses to carry us through a guided shamanic and somatic journey where we will ask for our dream to be revealed to us, and ask for a trail for us to follow to make it real in the world

Hope your day is beautiful

Id like to offer a yoga practice designed specifically for the needs of a festival goer This is the flow of it which Im open to revising

First finding stillness with guided meditation, connecting to the breath and to sensation

then embracing a playful joyous spirit, through facilitated silliness and self appreciative touch
 
invigotating the whole self with pranayama, 

dancing gracefully through asanas, mindfully opening energy chanels and nourishing the body for more dancing 

exploring vocal yoga physical and emotional release of vocal chords and Diphragm culminating with a sea of giggles, 

then a sea of oms

then a sweet savasana to seal in all the goodness   


I offered a similar workshop at Intention gathering, and wow, it was massively successful We were all so elated for it, you can ask Loretta Laurin or Tynan Rollo They are both organizers of intention and were both in my workshop  Im really excited to take what I learnt there and offer something even more delicious 

Thanks for reading and considering this! 

on the formal side, by way of credibility, I have a 200-h yoga teaching certificate from semperviva and have been practicing yoga since 2008 picking up a myriade of techniques along the way with experience in Hatha, Vijnana, Vinyasa, Yin, Kripalu, laughter yoga, and Kundalini yoga
I draw a lot of inspiration from Insight meditation I have complete 2, two week vipasana retreats, and I regualrly meditation

Teacher Bio: 
Lauren DeGaine
I recieved my BA degree in Yoga Teacher Training from Naropa University Led by Nataraja Kallio, it is the only undergraduate degree program in yoga in the United States The 3-year training explored anatomy, theory, philosophy, history and origins, physiology, therapeutics, the chakras and more My teaching philosophy revolves around well-being: yoga works with the body, but engages the mind and the emotions as well Yoga asks how can we use our practice to engage with the world as our most authentic self 

Often using the chakra system as a lens, my classes emphasize resetting the nervous system, developing body awareness, balancing the masculine and feminine energies and working towards a sustained experience of well-being Yoga is exercise, but it can also be a process which gradually transmutes discordant energies in the body toward a state of joy and heightened awareness

This winter I have had the privilege of debuting a handcrafted class, Sexy Restorative Flow, at Amethyst Dance and Fitness studio in Victoria, BC The inspiration from this class came from a desire to combine exercise with restoration, and to indulge my love of deep, sexy bass music This class gave me the opportunity to formulate and share the Luminosity Flow and the Warrior Goddess Flow IÄôm excited to bring these sequences to festivals this summer

Open relationships? Polyamory? Relationship Anarchy? For many people, ethical and honest non monogamy is about freedom: freedom to love who you want, when you want, in whatever way feels authentic between adults and is mutually consensual It has a rosy reputation for being about not putting limitations on whom or how you love, being able to acknowledge your needs and desires and dreams, knowing that to expect one person alone to fulfill all of them is way too much pressure 

But whatÄôs the reality? How do the myths differ from the practical applications? How does it actually work in real life? Is non monogamy some enlightened approach to living, or simply another set of options for relating to other humans? Is there a Golden Path to polyamorous perfection, or is it a multilinear dance where we each get to decide what works for us as individuals? 

Whether honest non-monogamy is new to you, or you have years of experience, this workshop promises to offer fresh and insightful perspectives, and empower you with new tools to assist you in enjoying more fulfilling relationships!

My practice comes in the form of a device called a Pineal Activation Light The Light uses an array of LED lights, which are set to strobe at frequencies which correlate with powerful healing, and meditative states It does so by stimulating the pineal gland, causing a release of endogenous tryptamines, which in turn, bring uses into states similar to those experienced with entheogens They are used primarily in healing centers, float houses, yoga schools, and therapeutic practices, but I have managed to successfully implement the light at various festivals/events, with a fully portable set up The light is a unique representation of spirit, and technology, much like the festivals I have attending with it 

To run my practice, I will set up a space in which participants -- individuals and small groups -- would be able to relax an ground themselves, and experience the effects of the light This would be done in a quiet spot, amidst other healers, or nestled away in a quiet patch of art If I am able to manage the logistics of transporting an 8x8 copper pyramid frame, it shall be set up under that

This an updated version of the talk I gave last year at Blessed Coast, this time with a year's experience in the new story of love and actionable principles for conscious relating for festival goers   This workshop has been successfully delivered at Rainbow Serpent & Earth Frequency Australia, and Envision Costa Rica   

HEALING OF LOVE: Sex, Partnership and the Village
Duration: 90 minutes
Tech requirements: none

Many are beginning to question the current story of love: the belief that we must find ""THE ONE"": a partner who will grant our happiness and fulfill all our needs And yet, with growing divorce rates, betrayal, and stressed partnerships, the old story isn't working for many Others are experimenting with various models of open relationship and alternative forms - some finding joy but also much heartache 

New paradigm filmmaker Ian MacKenzie and co-facilitator Mya Hardman aka AppleCat speak about the research from Tamera peace village in Portugal, exploring the foundations the new story in love and sexuality How might we cultivate communities of trust to support the freedom to love without fear? 

Whatever your relationship form, monogamy, polyamory or beyond, this workshop will explore the role of the community in healthy partnership

Conscious breathing allows your unconscious to open and release repressed emotions Connecting and opening our breath we are able to become present, raising our energy to feel a higher vibration, getting unstuck from old emotions Opening our heart with each breath to be able to feel all that we are feeling without vulnerability, making room for spirit and authenticity 

To sum up a breath workshop: We would start with a share circle to create a safe and sacred space for everyone Then we would start a breath activation to get our energy flowing and breathing a bit heavier Next we would start the breath session by lying down and staying in a conscious breath for an hour with myself and my partner their to support and do a bit of hands on facilitation to help get the oxygen flowing through the whole body To end we would have another share circle for people that want to share there experience and to talk to myself or Dalton for any addition support or grounding that is needed

What is a cacao ceremony? Chocolate + ecstatic dance healing and transformation Seriously, is anybody NOT down for some of that?


An Intentional ceremony to plant seed to hold space for each other to rise up as a community  with a heart opening experience with the cacao medicine, dance and breath 
Learn awareness about  energetic language and connection setting boundaries  Learn how to protect your energy, feel your self more ,  find your centre, use the elements to bring you to a blissful state

A space to learn how to use medicine with respect transforming our music festival experience into a healing journey of our body with awareness on how to heal  with dance, movement and breath 

Learn different shamanic dance ritual from all-around the world, tantra transformative eye gazing exercise, a deep journey for our masculine to hold space for the feminine to open up under the wings of the source 

My wish will be to bring my healing tipi to hold space during the whole week end as an intentional space to use medicine and to come back to to find our centre 
A space where we can share our gift, offer healing, support for each other, building community around it A goddess temple, a space where the masculine can treat the feminine with respect seeing the beauty softening up the goddess that we may still hide inside 
A space where we can rebalance our energy, where  we can get smudge and ground ourself
A space for healer to hold space where we can give and receive

What is cacao?
 Cacao ""just like the chocolate"" when drink pure into a warm drink mix in a special natural  magic intentional blend of plant medicine spice works as a natural anti depressive and a mussel relaxer When mindfully use with breath and healing dance awareness will send you into a beautiful natural ecstatic bliss Because of cacaoÄôs ability to increase your connection to your  inner self and your heart chakra, it aids in any transformational shift you are working towards, whether you are looking to deepen your understanding of who you are, release old patterns and traumas, or move into a more self-confident space Whatever your path, the intention is yours to set, and the cacao allows you to the insight and awareness to move towards that goal

Heart Journey Tipi is Giving back to the first Nation

The healing tipi is actually taking form in Mont Curry Asaya new age healer and Franky a First Nation elder Are starting to offer cacao ceremony , sweet lodge, traditional hoop dance class, survivor skills, permaculture courses, mystical dance and yoga Spreading a healing positive vibe to our land where trauma been experience in the past Bringing back the tradition, holding space for people of all colour to come to experience shamanic experience Our land offer women to step into their power teaching them also about nutrition, herbal medicine and garden skills, where children get to be creative and learn tradition that has been forgotten, where men are rising up, learning survivor skills and planting garden to provide to their family 

So in this project we would hope to get donation for the cacao that will be use to give back to the community and also to provide cacao medicine to the peoples, We have collect donation last year hoping to rise money for the community but we just paid for the cacao medicine

25/03/2016 17:13:42,Lucy Lambert,,lucyroselambert@hotmailcom,"IÄôd love to offer yoga classes at Blessed Coast 2016! The classes I guide are lighthearted, fun, and invigorating, and open to all levels from beginner to advanced yogis They are accessible while also being a unique fusion of stretches, fun exercises, and subtle energetic work which connects people in a meditative way to their energetic field I incorporate many breathing
techniques, mudras, and energy field exercises into the yoga class to make it
fun, engaging and semi-psychedelic
I have taught large classes as part of art and music festivals in the past and
they have been a great contribution to the atmosphere of those events I was booked for Blessed Coast last year and was so excited to teach there but had to cancel due to some complications in my life at the time I heard amazing things about the festival since then and am so excited to offer classes here this summer

As a teacher with experience teaching in festivals and musical events, I know how to keep the energy of the class playful, fun, and accessible to everyone who wants to participate
I can hold space for classes which
will bring people together, create a deeper sense of community and help to uplift the entire festival; once people are deeply connected with themselves and energized through the yoga practice, they can
have more to share with one another throughout the rest of the festival and
on the dance floor
I could hold a sunrise yoga class, or a morning/afternoon class, however best
fits the festival The class I guide will be one hour and is best suited to a
grassy area or any large, open space
Below are my references, and a link to my website where you can learn more about me
 So excited to contribute to this great event!

The teachings IÄôd like to offer come in the form of a one hour workshop about the different phases of the moon and how to harness the energy of each phase of the moon for a greater connection to the Goddess 

This session incorporates work with the archetypal philosophy of the cycles of the moon, and how to recognize and call upon these archetypes within our lives 
This workshop is practical, conversational and experiential; it incorporates guided meditation, dialoguing, lunar teachings, ritual, self reflection, conversation, and breath work so that people come out of this experience with a deeper connection to how the energy of the moon is present in all aspects of life We will also be sharing practices which we can do on our own after the festival which can help us to stay in tune with these rhythms

This workshop has been birthed from a four-hour workshop I run, called ÄòTools for the Wild WomanÄô, which is geared towards those who menstruate IÄôve put the link to my website and to this full workshop below I was asked last year to create a one hour version of this workshop for the Vancouver Full Moon Medicine Gathering which would focus on embodying the lunar phases and be equally accessible to both genders So, here it is!

I always love running this workshop because as much as I see it inspiring people who attend, I also learn a lot from the conversation and the unique ideas people bring for honoring the lunar cycles in their own way I know Blessed Coast would be a perfect place for us to bring attention to, and share in the wisdom of, the lunar Goddess and IÄôd be honored to hold that space

25/03/2016 18:22:09,Manjari Dasi,,munji_108@hotmailcom,"I have never put one on before But I am quite skilled and have quite a strong community of people who practice mantra meditaion, and would be very interested in sharing that with others to raise the vibrations of this festival to thier greatest extent and also invoke the most direct and effective blessings, for this blessed coast festival 
Primary Mantra being the Hare Krsna Maha Mantra 
I work shop could include a full break down and explanaition on all the features of said mantra The meaning of Mantra Man=Mind tra=to liberate, as just a taste 
What are the powers withing each word, ""Hare"" ""Krsna"" and ""Rama"" 
Also what is the benefit of chanting such names
Then could go on to a full call and response Kirtan, along with 2 or 3 other ""Kirtaniyas"" if permitted, and able to bring them up to the festival but most likely will be easy to do
Would also be honoured to be able to set a table up per donation of my spiritual masters books, Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayan Maharaja you can take a visit at bhaktistorenet or com to get an idea of what the books are like 

Oh also a little bit about myself sorry I am kind of excited as I write this 
but I am 23 and was born in the Bhakti tradition So talking and sharing about Bhakti Yoga is quite natural for me 
When I was around 11 years old I was taught the traditional mantras and methods for playing the traditional musical instrument for Kirtan, the Mridanga but a teacher from West Bengal, which is the birth place of the Mridanga, as well as Kirtan as we know it today 

I also travelled on a world tour for two months in 2011 with the world famous Hare Krishna Gaudiya Vaisnava artist,  Srimati Syamarani didi, as her personal servant And learned much more about the Science of Gaudiya Vaisnavism or the practice of bhakti Yoga in general You can see some of Srimati Syamarani dasi's art on her website, wwwbhaktiartnet as if possible, I would also make arrangements to have much of her art on display along with my Guru Maharaj's books 

And since that time it has been my primary goal in both my daily and long term plans to continue developing my practice as well as be able to share it with others, as is instructed by my Guru, Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayan Maharaja to all his disciples to try and follow 


So, long story short, if it was so possible to be able to share these gifts I have been so magnanimously blessed with, with my fellow Blessed Coast friends, I would be so grateful, and indebted 

I also would be 100% satisfied to just offer this as an exchange for entrance into this festival Aswell as one pass to have a friend come who can drive me and the supplies and perhaps her 8 year old daughter as well and potentially one friend to assist in the kirtan But whatever seems most fair 

Bless up~ and Hari Om!!!

In addition to teaching yoga, I also own my own business, Yoga Gypsy Creations  I hand create and sell yoga inspired jewelry mala beads and accessories such as lavender eye pillows, yoga mat bags, and a line of aromatherapy products such as yoga mat spray, body & massage oil, soaps and candles  I had a booth at the Squamish Farmer's Market all of last summer season  I am hoping to sell my creations again this summer at the market  

I would be so interested in being a part of your festival   I have recently started hosting Mala & Mantra Workshops in the Sea to Sky corridor I have one planned for Apr 23 at Yogacara and one in Vancouver on Apr 9 with an instructor from my school and her friends  I hosted two workshops in Pemberton last Fall with two separate stagette groups and they were a hit!!!

The following is the description of the workshop that I am hosting at Yogacara

Mala & Mantra Creative Workshop
In this special workshop you will create your very own Mala and then learn to use various mantras to bring about healing, peace, love and health Repeating mantras while using a Mala helps to cultivate and deepen a meditation practice This ancient practice enables one to release negative energy and to receive all that is positive and good in life We will end the workshop with an asana/yoga practice and all you need to do is come with an open heart to send out and receive positive energy

Since the workshop would require the cost of mala beads and supplies, I  am not certain that I could offer the workshop in exchange for a festival pass  I am definitely interested in a trade of some sort but my supplies would need to be covered  I would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this if you are interested in the idea  

Thank you for your time

The use of sound as a healing force is one of the most ancient human practices of medicine which is being rediscovered with profound implications in our modern era The ancients often used sound and music to treat the essence of the human being, the soul itself, as the finer energies of vibration are able to relate and connect to our deeper aspects This is also seen as getting to the very root of much dis-ease Beyond its healing applications, the whole paradigm of sound healing opens a new horizon of engaging an energetic sense of reality and particularly in connecting to the vibrational intelligence of the Heart This is literally a re-enchantment of the world, as our perception shifts to feeling our way through life, garnering union with the guiding wisdom of the universe and its subtle intuitive powers As we come to realize our source as vibrational entities, it changes the whole way we live, giving us new skills of empowerment to foster lives of evolving potential Using the voice as a healing tool emboldens this vibrational sensibility Participants will learn simple ways to use the voice as a sound healing instrument to transform energy blockages in our being, enthuse intention, transform our moods and how to utilize sound in groups to foster powerful unifying space Participants will be introduced to the use of sound and music as medicine drawing from the wisdom of the ancients and modern innovations The workshop will conclude with a mystical performance of the crystal singing bowls and a group chant for world peace ",,Yes

My given name is Kat Bickert but the name given to me by my guru is Maa Karuna Ananda, meaning Mother of compassionate Bliss

I would be teaching way for visionaries to deepen connection to what I call their ""Cosmic Essence"" through simple practices like ceremony, prayer, meditation and yoga I will teach the 8-Limb Formula to Cosmic Bliss Samadhi as passed down in the Ashtanga Yoga tradition from Rishi Patanjali in the yoga Sutras, explain an 8-step process to deepen connection & power to manifest vision through prayer, and the importance of mastering basic foundational yoga postures 

I will end the workshop by guiding in a special pranayama passed down to me by my guru that instantly deepens meditation and guide students through a body awareness meditation 

I mainly focus on teaching visionaries because those who have the vision for peace, harmony and abundance on earth, are the ones often working towards that end The issue is that many of us visionaries are up in the clouds with our big beautiful vision, yet our lives are lived incongruently to this vision in some way A large factor is that when someone with a great power of vision hasn't deeply grounded themselves in the physical world before performing their work, their actions have a large potential energy left untapped

By teaching visionaries the power of simple but deep grounding practices, their level of presence and awareness increases and the power to manifest their vision through their daily actions increases Through tapping into the internal reservoir of the Cosmic Sense of Self we awaken our Divine power and restore peace and balance",,Yes

I would love to do one of a few workshops If there is any interest in any of the following, please let me know and I will reply with a full description:

1 Intro to Permaculture - Working in whole-systems design, we can create and hold space in a way that is in alignment with what is Rather than asserting our will on the landscape, we can work with the landscape to create a holistic and easy way of life While supporting indigenous sovereignty, local plants and animals, we can integrate the 12+ permaculture principles into our life and our projects in all aspects 

2 Intro to Dynamic Governance consensus - Consensus works! We can empower ourselves and our communities by working in consensus to create the decisions without pushing an agenda on anyone We can use circles and mutual respect to create an intention for collaboration, while moving forward decisions quickly and in alignment

3 The Mutualism Hub - Social enterprise networking! Let's share what we do in circle, what we have to offer in abundance, and what we are looking for assistance with If we come from a place of service to Mother Earth, we can manifest in an ethical way! 

4 Ecovillages as Living Conscious Community Centres - What are ecovillages and intentional communities really doing? They are holding space to innovate on all levels of society, from the local community within the village, to the surrounding community, to the global peace pilgrammage currently occuring We are coming together as a species and beings around the planet to create a new story that is based on peace, acceptance, love, trust, and true justice Ecovillages are the sanctuary and consciousness hubs that are anchoring this space for us to connect and create the future we want

Adam Miller is a sound healer who was certified by Suren Shrestha in Napal and has developed a medicinal sound journey using instruments from around the world Joshua Hedge is a certified Reiki healer who has studied under many brilliant teachers in a number of different modalities and does auric cleansing along with chakra re-alignment Matthew Nelson is our dome and alternative energies technition, and there are 4 tea servers and 2 entrance greeters

This would also be an option at Bass Coast If we had a separate permaculture dome, we would be able to have multiple discussions, projects and examples of alternate energy, an area for people to get a bit more hands on and connect with nature, and build a sense of community over the course of the weekend We would also volunteer our sound healing Cory and I normally arrive on festival grounds a week early or so to build various structures, do some landscaping, set up composts and composting toilets, ect 

I strongly feel called to invite this conscious group of people who attend to form a deeper connection to the land and to each other through sacred ancient wisdom and sound I also teach ecstatic yoga and would love to volunteer to lead a practice at our dome

One of our biggest hurdles in life can be letting go, whether it be of emotions, material items or one of the biggest road blocks for aspiring artist, perfection  In this workshop, we will use art as a tool to work on letting go of some of these blockages 
Attendees will learn how to draw a symmetrical image as well as develop detail in their design  At the same time, we will be looking at ways to let go of expectations in our art, which will pave the road to letting go of the big things in life that weigh us down 
The 90 minute workshop will include an opening circle, time to create symmetrical design,  as well as time to share our experience or blockages in letting go then finishing with a closing circle


**A bit about me;
Through travel, festival and life experience, I have developed my artistic skill, which has been a transformational tool in my self growth and healing, allowing me to move beyond a very difficult past and bring myself into a lighter, happier more fulfilling life Over the last year, I have been using these tools to inspire others to do the same 
Last year, I facilitated my Symmetry Art workshop at Zion Noiz, however, this year I have altered it to be more than just an art workshop but a healing workshop as well I also facilitated my Turbulence of Travel' workshop at Fozzy Fest, where we look at the difficult times we have had through travel and find the lessons through telling reflecting and relating 
This year, I have been practicing my revised Symmetry art workshop with friends and community members, and have already been accepted to facilitate at Zion Noiz and Astral Harvest  

I am also a Reiki Master practitioner and may be willing to do Reiki healing sessions after my workshop I incorporate my Reiki healing with aromatherapy and symbol art therapy by applying symbols with essential oil infused henna

Writing
I could teach a writing workshop focused on connecting with and exploring creativity I find that people can be nervous about writing but many people have compelling stories to tellso I would focus on the creative process and lead people through a series of prompts to get their ideas down and give them shape I would make it fun I have a Masters in creative writing and have taught writing for the past 16 years I currently teach at Emily Carr University

Hello! 

I heard about this festival through my friend Alex Sadowski We  both worked at Karma Food Co-Op in Toronto together! 

I have hosted a workshop called Calling All Change Makers in both Toronto,ON and Tacoma, WA 

Calling all Change Makers is a two hour creative forum based on Theory U for social innovators of all ages/disciplines to connect, explore, and cultivate change Participants find support for their passions, and create better alternatives together! 

Participants will leave knowing they have support, a greater knowledge of what resources they can utilize, and how their passions can develop further once their feet enter back into the world I can send you a powerpoint of the questions asked and the process if  you desire 

More information about Theory U can be found at the Presencing Institute: https://wwwpresencingcom/

Theory U is also the foundation for the Ontario Youth Fellowship Program called Studio Y 

I would be happy to do one or multiple workshops as the outcome is different depending on the participants involved https://wwwmarsddcom/systems-change/studio-y/studio-y-fellowship/

2 The Permaculture Game: Find others throughout the course of the festival and connect around permaculture Discuss the principles based on the initial workshop, and write down any notes, important quotes, journal entries, or any other way to share our stories around permaculture at Blessed Coast

3 After the Gathering: Participants will have the option to complete a review of their experience and send it in to receive a Certificate that they have completed the Intro to Permaculture and played the Permaculture Game at Blessed Coast over their 72 hours there It will include questions written or drawn answers, a Facebook group for discussion, chance to submit designs for Blessed Coast and other gatherings to consider, and give links to resources and books that can help in their permaculture journey 

This is a great way to connect diverse people around permaculture It doesn't compete with any other permaculture workshops but is only improved by them, as people have a chance to play with and engage in their knowledge It gives them a certificate that they can then use to move into other areas of permaculture from a place of knowledge

""Sustainability for millennial's""

Introduction: 
This is about a 30-45 minute group workshop that will help to inform and educate our current generation on how to design anything in a sustainable frame of mind Weather it be physical products, art, music, fashion, or even if you want to make your daily life more sustainable, this is the catalyst to get the natural reaction going!

Outline: There will be a short introduction of myself and background, followed by a group exercise involving participants and getting them thinking in the right state of mind! We will then dive into the main focus of the workshop, 2 case studies The first is a look at the declining industry of physical print design vs against the ever growing digital graphic design industry This will lay out what some people already know about sustainability, which is the environmental part But in the next case study, the story of a sustainable restaurant in Vancouver BC that is striving to stay above water in tough times while battling against the corporate chains that just feed on profits This topic will help to grow everyones understanding of what it means to be ""sustainable"", over catch phrases like ""going green, or being environmental/social conscious"" This will cover most of the lecture, if there are not too many questions throughout this period and time is going well, another case study or example will be presented to further expand upon the subject From there we will participate in a second group exercise where we come up with ideas in small groups of products of ideas we can make more sustainable using the information we just learned There will be a short conclusion and information given on where to find out more, and time for final questions at the end


Some of the key notes addressed will be:
-The definition of sustainability, ÄúMeeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsÄù
-The three pillars of sustainability: enivronmentally sound economically viable, and socially just
-The principles of sustainable design: learning from natural systems, respect for energy/resources, respect for people, respect for place, respect for future, and systems thinking
-practical steps designers can take to make a difference: design for use, dematerialization, design for disassembly, substution, localization, transmaterialization, design for durability, design for reuse unintended & intended, and redesigning the system 
-Setting up sustainable framework, ie: LCAlife cycle assessment, The Green table Network, Oceanwise certification, making your own DIY

A little about myself: I am a Sustainable Graphic Designer that grew up in Vancouver, BC I Studied at the vancouver art institute and graduated with a Bachelors of applied design, minoring in sustainability I have been working freelance for the last year and a bit now, and before that I worked in a firm and some corprate positions ",,Yes

1  Waist Hooping for Beginners 30 - 60 minutes
2  Weave your magic  60 mins - this is a workshop to learn how to do weaves with double hoops  Can be taken by beginners or intermediates as I will keep adding on higher challenges depending on who shows up and how much they know
3  Creative Pathways/Curious Transitions 60-90 minutes Can be taken by all levels beginners to advanced  Learn to develop new ways of transitioning between moves by tapping into one's own flow and learning to move from an authentic expressions of self  Music is required for this workshop

10/06/2016 22:43:30,Cody Wicks,,mutualismhub@gmailcom,"Emergence

We are in a period of emergence We are letting go of control and hierarchy, and allowing, surrendering, to what is wanting to come through us What is wanting to emerge 

We can connect with and honour ourselves and through this, connect with and honour others 

I would love to hold an emergence circle and workshop for Blessed Coast Of course, this nessesarily means allowing for what wants to emerge in the circle 

Most commonly, this will go in two general directions:

Inwards: I-circle inside ourselves, we will share what is going on for us, and our reflections and mirrors will share what this brings up for them in what they are going through, and so-on This is a sign that we as a group have healing to do together in the interior of our souls Our karma Our conditioning Our memories It can be seen in many lights, through  many stories In a safe space, we can go inside

Outwards: O-circle will usually start with an I-circle round, where we go inwards and find that what we want is to look outwards To see what we can manifest We may share our dreams, passions, loves, ideas, visions It will be facilitated in such a way that what wants to emerge will emerge In one workshop, we ended up self-organizing into 4 groups to brainstorm and create 4 crowdfunding campaigns for those that really had a fire going to manifest their passions in that moment Other times, we may do rounds and share what we are all creating, and leave space to connect afterwards and self-select into long-term relationships of manifestation 

It can take any shape, always for the highest good, into ourselves and into the universe around us Humanity is at an inflection point, where we move into the 'yellow' or 'teal' areas of spiral dynamics, seeing the full power of our collective experience, stories, and will And integrating it We are moving into a complex ecosystem where it is impossible to map ahead of time what is emerging, yet we can see patterns and work with what is 

This is also an intro to social permaculture workshop that will draw heavily on the permaculture principles

The problem is the solution: If a problem comes up, we will crowd source a solution through our collective spirit 

Respect and honour diversity: Any group that comes together is unique, and if we get away from our assumptions and expectations, this particular group can create something as unique as it is Something that could resonate through the planet in a wave and ripple of peace

Produce no waste: Everything we hear is a mirror in which to see our own consciousness As Alan Watts says, ""The eye can see, but it cannot see itself"" 

Use Edges and Value the Marginal: Will we see our edges as exciting areas of innovation, growth, and challenge Or will we see them as triggering and stress? I will hold space to go into whatever arises and value the marginal areas of our current consciousness as we expand together 

Observe and Interact: Through observation of ourselves, our triggers, our interests, our connections, our reflections, our mirrors, we can see and interact with the world in a way we otherwise cannot Together we are strong

Creatively Use and Respond to Change: I have no idea what will come up in this group Even if I did, things may change with no notice As a group, and as individuals, we can creatively use and respond to changes in the way this group comes together to find what spirit is trying to say through us 

Catch and Store Energy: What energy is coming with us? What is trying to emerge? It can be anything! What ever energy comes up, we will catch and store in quantum manifestation If we can hold energy into a solid space, it will be able to move through the system in a way that we want with intention 

Apply Self-regulation and Apply Feedback: As self-aware individuals, we can look inside and apply self-regulation and accept and apply feedback from those around us If the space is held safely and with intention, self-responsibility, and with love, we can use all reactions and responses to create a better world for ourselves and those around us 

Design From Patterns to Details: We can see the patterns in ourselves and those around us, we can see patterns in nature that indicate ways that we can move for a more sustainable and loving future Whether looking inwards or outwards, patterns can indicate the stories we need to listen to 

Integrate Rather Than Segregate: Sometimes we have a group with seemingly conflicting ideas, or rather stories, that come up This can be the greatest gift, if we are brave enough to stand and hold space for it We can find the overlap between even the most seemingly diverse set of stories, and show our common humanity and goals for peace and love on earth We all want to belong, let's be the change 

Use and Value Renewnable Resources and Services: Almost enough said there If we are creating and showing up from our highest good, from our passionate centre, we can channel from spirit and renew ourselves and the planet around us 

Use Small and Slow Solutions: Sometimes, taking the time to go around the circle is the most healing and innovative thing to do Giving each person a chance to hear and reflect on what their mirrors are showing them can be a huge gift Small and slow, we will create a new world outside of the time paradigm 



There are many ways this can go I am very open to doing a short workshop over a few hours as I am to having a space that we hold space for this throughout the entire festival This is my passion and journey in life and there would be nothing that brings me more joy than to bring an emergence point into Blessed Coast 

Much love,

Cody Wicks",,Yes

For me, dance is a true expression of our souls and also showing us our physical and mental blockages The way we move and are moved by Life is showing us a clear mirror of ourselves and can deeply contribute to our evolution  In this always accelerating world we are living in, dance is a powerful tool to clear the mind and come back to our senses Offering a dance floor where we can get out of the box, re-connect with our body/spirit and transcend the fears is one of the purpose of my offerings  In doing so, we are opening ourselves to the divine/sensual aspect of ourselves and taping in our healing power By creating a balance between guidance and free dancing, we enter in a sacred space where we can receive, share and grow

This offering is a journey where we let go of the mind and come back to embodying the Goddess/God that we are We open our bodies to the ÄùjuicyÄù aspect of Life, giving ourselves permission to move exactly the way we want to, the way it feels good for us! Integrating sensuality, letting go of the fear and coming back to beauty of the senses which are a doorway towards connecting with the divine

In the end participants not only have the opportunity to strengthen their connection with and learn from one another, but also have a chance to re-connect with the teachings of the Medicine wheel and become better equipped to carry with them this practical tool of the sharing circle which, can then be utilized in our own communities and homes in order to assist with our ability to honour our relationships with ourselves, others and all that exists and transform our lives

""As a couple we have seen first hand within our own relationship, and with our two boys the importance and value of the sharing circle - which is the main reason why we travel the country sharing this tool within homes and schools  Recognizing it may be the most essential tool for us to utilize in order to re-connect with one another by creating the space to openly communicate our emotions in a safe, respectful way  Allowing us to gain a mutual understanding for one another while being able to practice the essential skills of expressing our emotions, being present/able to listen to one another, and recognize that we do in fact have the ability to process anything and everything we face in life - especially when we are able to do it together"" ",,Yes

I would love the opportunity to offer poi spinning workshops at your festival! For anyone that doesn't know, poi spinning can be considered a circus flow art and involves spinning weighted balls on the end of strings, usually one in each hand Poi spinning originated as a Maori tradition to improve warriors wrist/arm flexibility and dexterity, and has now developed into a performance art, with fire performance and urban street circus being two major forms
I have personally been spinning poi for two years now, having performed with both fire and LED poi at various events, including the Whistler Blackcomb Fire and Ice shows I have also spent many hours teaching poi to various people including friends and more formal arrangements I can offer instruction right from complete beginner moves up to advanced techniques, performance considerations and improving general flow In terms of workshops I am happy to offer multiple workshops at different standards or just adapt to the class based on demand
I am an avid yoga enthusiast and mostly follow the Ashtanga practice although I have enjoyed many Iyengar and Hatha classes I would love the opportunity to be a part of and contribute to this event as I feel that is the best way to experience festivals
