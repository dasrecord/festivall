The vision of this festival is so inspiring and aligned with what we want to bring and be a part of.   \n\nMelissa (DJ Caçadora) and I are also reggae DJ's who play reggae at the Reef here in Victoria and another way we could contribute is by playing a DJ set either together or separately.

        "bio": "Reggaelution was born under the sweet sunshine of the Vancouver summer of 2011. While jamming on the beach, singer/guitarists Zach Cornfield and Damon Hanly lamented the fact that there was nowhere in their city to go to listen to the old-school reggae hits they so enjoyed playing. After pondering on this for a brief moment, the obvious solution to this simple problem became apparent: start a reggae band! A couple of weeks later, the curly-haired duo did just that, and recruited bassist Leo Bell and drummer Mike Ramos to complete the lineup. After a successful outdoor gig at The Libra Room during Car Free Days on Commercial Drive, the band went on to secure a monthly gig at the local East Van music hotspot. The band has since played the Make Music Festival in Vancouver, and has also brought their irie vibes to shows in Squamish and Whistler. Reggaelution also recently played to their largest crowd yet at the Vancouver Art Gallery for the Cannabis Day rally. Playing everything from Desmond Dekker to Barrington Levy, Bob Marley to Jacob Miller, Burning Spear to Gregory Isaacs, the band focuses on bringing that laid back roots reggae sound to their live shows, which inevitably end up with people dancing on their feet, or at the very least, grooving in their seats.

Finding new clarity through human connections, Sub Theory’s evolution as an artist continues. Saturated with bass, heavy drums and laced with heavy dub/reggae sounds. Sub Theory is much more than a collection of beats; it is a musical project that reflects the culmination of almost a decade’s worth touring and performing. Laying his hands on production and live performance, Sub Theory brings together a potent mix of Bass dub, and ethnic fusion in to his sets.\n\nTo his ever-expanding fanbase, Sub Theory is much more than a DJ or producer; he is a master crafter of the collective experience, a shaman of spiritual escape found by following the beats. The journey continues; turning 34 this year, Sub Theory has only scratched the surface of himself as an artist and a person. Resonating on a deeper level, this is Sub Theory’s spirit shining through the haze, breaking through the foggy veil of singularity to find the human connection.",

I can do all kinds of styles - the only thing that stays consistent between my sets is that I loop it all live (and it's improvised). I would love to play a trippy downtempo set, a funky housey set, a live rock set, a dnb set, etc. \n\nI would also love to collaborate with other musicians there. I'd love to be able to lay down a beat and a bass groove, and then just rock out with some other peeps all on our own various instruments. If you guys have a drumset there too, that would be phenomenal (I've been playing the drums for 10+ years) - though I'd need to practice here in Vancouver first in order to integrate it into my live show. \n\nAs far as requirements go, I don't really have any... Ideally you guys would be able to have an audio interface I could use for my set, since mine is super heavy and I don't have a vehicle... Transportation + a safe place to leave my gear actually might be a reuiqrement? Not sure - I'd have to figure out logistics. \n\nAn awesome thing to have would be a video feed from the stage so that people watching can see what I'm doing (they can connect the sounds they hear directly to what I do with my various machines!). \n\nAnyway this is getting pretty long, so I'll end this application now. In case it isn't clear from here, I have a lot of energy and would love to be part of the entertainment for One Love. Sounds like a wicked festival.",

I have to cater to bar fans at those gigs but I'm very very passionate about spinning music that inspires love, peace, creativity and unity. Music is an integral part of my life, it's literally all I do. If I'm not listening to music for other people to jam to I'm listening to music to get me inspired to create. I DJ acid jazz, psychedelic rock and psychedelic music in general, blues, folk, reggae, downtempo, electronica, hip hop, classic rock, neo psychedelia, ambient, and more. I don't limit my musical genres I just mix what sounds good and gets the crowd dancing and shouting with love. I also am a hip hop artist with lots of finished songs I could incorporate into my DJ set, my lyrics are about consciousness and life and energy, not the generic rapper lyrics you would think of when you hear Hip Hop. This is Hip Hop from the mind, body and soul. Music at it's purest. You can check out two of my tracks at www.soundcloud.com/originofspin . Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!

From David Suzuki's Blue Dot Tour at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver, to the Uplift Festival & Woodford Festival in Australia, I have humbly shared stages and panels with artists like Feist, The Barenaked Ladies, David Suzuki, Trevor Hall, Hey Ocean, Natalie Rize, Nahko Bear, and Neil Young, in the hopes of spreading a message of hope and action. \n\nI am proud to stay connected to where I call home, and I feel blessed to be a part of a musical community that includes sharing stages and collaborating with other lower-mainland Coast-Salish performers including Buckman Coe, Erin Sage & Warless, Emily Molloy, Will Ross, Leah Barley, and Sliammon Nation artist & activist Ta'Kaiya Blaney. Ta'Kaiya and I just completed a month-long speaking and music tour in Australia, and I look forward to more opportunities where I can make music & share the message of using our voice to speak up for the rights of the land and the people.\n\nMaking music with my sister, who travels with me as my only bandmate, is an especially magic experience - she mirrors me so intuitively. Her subtle & intelligent musicianship compliments my raw dynamic energy, and to do what you love with your family is an incredible gift that I adore sharing with the world. \n\nI'm currently on tour across Canada (hello from Thunder Bay, Ontario!). I thrive when performing in conscious spaces - the tour includes stops at yoga studios, prayer spaces, collective houses, and high schools. The last show will be in Vancouver on May 16th at Groundswell Grassroots Business Collective & Cafe.\n\nONLINE\nwebsite - corrinakeeling.ca\nbandcamp - corrinakeeling.bandcamp.com \ntwitter - twitter.com/corrinakeeling \nsoundcloud - soundcloud.com/corrinakeeling \nyoutube - youtube.com/corrinakeeling \nthe jellyfish project - thejellyfishproject.org/corrina-keeling\n\nVIDEO LINKS\nhttp://vimeo.com/114940784 http://vimeo.com/114940783 http://youtu.be/D_c7N6tcQoM\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",

As  a resident artist and a board member of 'The Jellyfish Project', an international coalition of musicians for the environment, I speak to artists and musicians about leveraging their power and influence as creatives towards creating environmental and social change. The project works to mobilize the music industry to speak up for the environmental realities of our time and empowers bands and artists to be part of the solution, in alignment with First Nations leadership and solidarity (take a look at thejellyfishproject.org).\n\n\nI also have an enormous love of hand-lettering, and have a tendency to leave a trail of beautiful and uplifting signs wherever I go. You can see a bit of my work at instagram.com/lovelettersforeverybody, or for a bit more of a detailed look at my work as an artist in service of community, at lovelettersforeverybody.ca. \n\nMost importantly, I am lit up on learning and service, and feel there are no better spaces to learn more about who we really are and how we can create better ways to support & care for each other than when connecting with music & art, the land, and each other. I offer my music to my incredible community wherever possible, from fundraisers to conferences, and I try to remember to walk through the world joyfully and as a student in the hopes that makes me teachable in every space I enter.\n",

They recorded their first full length record, Freeloader, which was released August 2014 and has been getting great reviews. A mix of many different genres, Will likes to refer to the sound as “acoustic funkified folk rock and roll.”\n\nLinks to sounds: \n\nhttp://willross.bandcamp.com/track/freeloader\n\nhttp://willross.bandcamp.com/track/not-the-predicate\n\nWe typically charge $600-$800 for shows however price is always negotiable :).",

His dimension-shattering innovational sounds are unparalleled from dolphins, whales, birds and ufo’s, to all-encompassing “walls of sound”. From trance like, water dripping, rainbow portal inspired songs of ascension, to thunderous cell penetrating sonic sound healing to the most delicate harmonics or lightning fast licks, he is the full package. Grammy nominee and Independent music winner, who has been featured on MTV’s Real World, Fusion TV in Mexico, National Public Radio, Wisdom Radio, Burning Man Festival and have been on major world tours as opening act from Sarah McLaclan, Joe Satriani, Chicago, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne and many others. Using crystals, stones, lasers, violin bow, meteorites, ankle bells and more, this explosive and eternally spontaneous musician puts on a stellar show that one never forgets and the inspiration that the crowd feeds on is overflowing. Playing the guitar with a love filled joy tuned to an ancient frequency, leaves one’s senses coated in fractals, harmonics, and DNA-upgrading sounds of color, cradled in the arms of rebirth, transformation and bliss. He is a very passionate, dynamically rhythmic, instrumental, one man band performer, developing complex and very energetic world tribal progressions on his alternately tuned guitar. His creative guitar sound can easily fill huge venues. He is truly a show stopper that leave audiences wanting more. As author, poet, musician, sound healer and truly an inventor of unique sounds, Scott continues to penetrate the uncharted territories of sonic reality, through his intuitive constancy of ever innovative techniques. He is forever polishing the diamond of sound. \nFor more info: www.scotthuckabay.com\n\n*Here's a recent live video clip of Scott performing the song, 'State of Profusion': http://youtu.be/J_LgtyA4E4A",

He has a unique propensity for meshing smooth rhythms and legendary guitar chops with driving and hypnotic melodies around deeply relevant subject matter. Drew has six albums and plays songs of many genres, styles, and volumes (from supper-club quiet to Rock n' Roll clubs and festivals) but his music is most often classified as Conscious Soul Music. Drew performs solo acoustic, with a full rhythm section or as a duo with a bass player/backup singer, his loop pedal and guitar, layering guitar parts, three-part harmonies, bass and drum beats for a full, smooth and danceable sound. Drew Rouse and his band are able to play three one-hour sets of live, original music which is easily suited to a variety of different venues.\n \ndrewrouse.com\n\n\"The consciousness is rising because some of us are lifting it\" ~D.R.",

        "bio": "Meet Vancouver’s rising vocal talent, Sophia Danai, whose voice is as honest as her lyrics with a sound that ranges from alternative r&b to sultry electro-pop. Okayplayer dubbed her a mix of Billie Holiday and Portishead, adding that she’s a \"dynamic singer with an obvious foundation in soul”. After leaving her first record-contract with The Hastings set due to creative differences, Sophia went back to school to enhance her skills as a producer and sound engineer so she could have more control over her creative process and further explore her artistry.  With a new found sense of empowerment as an independent artist, Sophia has created a new record in which the raw beauty of her voice takes centre stage. \n\nHer debut album, Love Royale, set to be released in February 2016, is an evocative collection of songs intended to take the listener on an introspective journey.  Sophia has spent the last two years honing her production skills, and collaborating with a variety of artists and producers such as Grammy award winning, Jon Brown (Meghan Trainor, Pink) and Vancouver's own, Matt Brevner. Inspired by Brown's LA studio, built inside one of Marilyn Monroe's early homes, Sophia's newly released single and music video, Daytime Dreaming, has an essence of old hollywood glamour. With its compelling arrangement of music and lyrics, Daytime Dreaming tells a story of longing for something more.\n\nWith the release of her first EP, Wishing Well, 2013 was a breakthrough year for Sophia. Wishing Well was produced by grammy award winner Chin Injeti, and featured Talib Kwali, Shad and DJ Khalil. Her song, \"Higher Baby\", was licensed to Appleton Rum for a nation wide advertising campaign, and she garnered two Juno nominations for her work with Madchild, and rising stars SonReal and Rich Kidd. Sophia, a dynamic performer, has shared the stage with Aloe Blacc, Quadron, and De La Soul. Other notable performances include last year's Manifesto Festival in Dundas Square Toronto, and the 102nd Grey Cup Festival in Vancouver.\n\nSophia, always evolving in her artistry, is a talent to watch for. Look out for her touring across Canada and the U.S. in support of Love Royale.\t\n\"If you can imagine a perfect balance between the sass of the Spice Girls and the depth of Aretha Franklin, it would be Sophia Danai. Not only does the sound of her voice pierce past your soul like a spear, but she also has as much energy and positivity as the sun.\"  - ION MAGAZINE.",

We honour that tradition with a festive flair, though we add our own interpretations and play several tunes outside of that genre. We are between 8 and 12 musicians, and feature combinations of up to 3 trumpets and 5 tubas of varying sizes, 2 drummers, saxophone, and clarinet, with many of us taking turns as singers. Most of our songs are sung in Romani or Serbian/Macedonian. We are now in our seventh year, and have a solid lineup of excellent musicians who have learned this music style directly from Roma trumpet master Demiran Cerimovic, whom we bring annually from Serbia. We have honed a repertoire of over 50 tunes, ranging from traditional wedding tunes to more modern jazz-influenced pieces and party songs.",

Both from what I have heard via word of mouth and reading Blessed Coast's vision, it seems that this festival is making excellent strides to push this culture forward through intelligent programming. As the workshop co-ordinator for Luminosity Gathering both last year and in 2016 I make an effort to present a workshop lineup that also includes a focus on permaculture, sustainability and a respectful relationship with local indigenous people. I would be honoured to be able to attend Blessed Coast this year and foster a healthy cross pollination of ideas and inspiration in order to help grow the festival scene in this area into a mature and genuinely transformational culture.

I enjoy some sharing time after most journeys, though sometimes a mandala creation or journaling is more appropriate. I begin by softly guide participants into their breath, as they lay on the ground, connecting deeply to the core of the earth. I  bring on the large frequencies of the bowls and then vowels and tones of voice. I use a beautiful, strong voice that brings people deep into their journey and holds just as strong of a loving, nurturing space for whatever comes up. \nAfter the journey, I play the lyre and pyramid over bodies, some energy work, soft touching if consented, and I bring people slowly back to the ground, their bodies and this physical space.

        "bio": "Sleepwreck is the sound of cyborgs dancing around a ritual bonfire. As primal as it is forward reaching, as organic as it is technological, this Music is electronic and it is alive. Having spent a lifetime in study of the magic and science of sound, Sleepwreck's all original productions and live performance are a bold re-imagination of the genre of electronica, and a challenge to dancefloors to move in new and unexpected ways.\n\nStepping outside the boundaries of simple genre classification, Sleepwreck's sound ranges from lush atmospheric textures, to hard hitting syncopated grooves, from heavy pulsing basslines to otherworldly vocal melodies. In the studio he crafts shoe-gazing, emotional downtempo one minute and whomping tribal dance music the next.\n\nHe takes the stage as a war-painted shamanistic alter-ego, while his coven of face painting, incense burning, flag waving Priestesses rallies the crowd. His phat, clean production is juxtaposed against the raw energy of real-world voice, acoustic/electric guitars, and pounding tribal floor toms. No matter where you hear him, at home on your headphones or spattering you with sweat while putting your nearest PA system through it's paces, Sleepwreck's honesty, passion, and enthusiasm are intense and infectious. His ability to surrender himself to Music is remarkable and difficult not to be inspired by.\n\n2015 saw a busy summer of festival and club dates around Western Canada, including a well received debut appearance at Shambhala Festival (arguably the most important event of it's kind in Canada), and an anticipated return to Astral Harvest Festival. Having featured a mixtape (currently with over 16,000 plays) in the official Shambhala mix series as well as a track on the festival compilation album and with a growing list of exciting remixes and collaborations, Sleepwreck has stepped up as an artist to watch for in the vibrant West Coast electronic community. After the successful release of his debut EP with trend setting bass music label Street Ritual Recordings (Oakland California), his follow up effort entitled \"Disasterpiece\" was released with East Van Digital Records (Kytami, LongWalkShortDock, The Librarian, etc.) in  February 2016. Gaining acclaim from fans and critics alike, the EP has already broken into the Beatport Top 10 for Glitch-Hop, as well as charting on independent radio across Canada. Having just completed a Western Canadian tour featuring live performance lighting by longtime collaborator Dr. Isocellator, and with performances slated for Canadian Music week as well as a number of summer festivals, 2016 will see Sleepwreck taking the next big steps in bringing his unique Music to the world.",

        "comments": "Sleepwreck Input List/Technical Requirements:\n2 DI's\n- I/We send 2 balanced quarter inch signals (left and right) to the main sound board. Either two DI's or a single stereo DI is needed. If necessary I/we can send RCA left/right to a DJ mixer.\n\nPower Outlet\n- A single clean AC power outlet is sufficient for the solo setup, duo and trio setup requires two/three outlets. \n\nSound Check\n- Whenever possible a sound check with a professional sound engineer over the main PA system is greatly appreciated and contributes to the quality of performance. The opportunity to optimize the system for frequency response is very valuable. Whether a sound check is possible or not we prefer that the front of house EQ leave the low frequencies intact (30-40Hz) as intentional use of this range is made.\n\nMics, Stands, Etc.\nI/We carry all of our own mics, stands, etc.\n\nSleepwreck - Performance Rider\nPlease note that “Sleepwreck” is written as one word with only the initial letter capitalized (unless the whole word is to be capitalized).\n\nSolo Set:\nI carry my own stand for the performance station, but can also set up on a DJ table if necessary. If a DJ table is present and space allows, being placed in front of it is ideal as this lets the audience see what I'm doing, and gives me space to rock out. If the performance station case is to be placed on a DJ table alongside DJ equipment I need 32 inches by 25 inches of clear space to accommodate it. For fly-in performances or stages with less space/smaller budget, a solo set can be stripped down to require less gear than shown in the stage plot.\n\nDuo/Trio Set (with live drummer and/or live performance lighting):\nIf space allows, placement in front of DJ booth is ideal. Please ensure that the stage surface is level and stable.\n\nSet Time/Mood: As a live performer of all original music I have less flexibility than a DJ. Please communicate set times (and/or desired mood) well in advance so that I can be sure that the material I have prepared is appropriate. I have mid/up-tempo material suitable for late/headlining slots, and under certain circumstances can perform improvised downtempo material that works well for a morning or afternoon set.\n\nWhen creating promotional materials (both print and online), please use only the pictures/logos provided in the EPK (which can be downloaded here: http://sleepwreck.com/SLEEPWRECK-EPK.zip).

        "bio": "Proposal for Installation\n\nArtists: Dallas Mangnell & David Zunker \nTitle of Installation: \"The Goddess Pond\"\n\nInstallation Themes\nThe ideas of gratitude, acceptance, community, love, innocence, joy, a wide range of themes to an inner spiritual realization projected outward to the world community. Focus and center point would be to hold sacred space for attendees at the festival (overview of the process below).\nInstallation requirements\nSuitable area is required to set up a sacred space.  Materials brought to the event are as follows: event tent, tent decorations, a shallow portable pond, carpets, cushion seating.\nOverview\nThe installation is would be low key, yet inviting in appearance, similar to a caravan tent, with multi-coloured fabric hung to provide atmosphere. Lighting is subdued, small LED lights with a combination of real candle light where possible. At the rear of the tent is the dedicated alter space, holding crystals and other spiritual items.  Seating is arranged around the perimeter of a shallow pond filled with water.  \nThe installation is a place people seek out for calm, to find peace, to rest and ground. The spiritual atmosphere is intentionally created and maintained with the presence of an authentic priest or priestess, who holds the space as sacred. The use of tobacco and alcohol are not permitted in the Goddess Pond. We or a representative is there to minister to any and all who attend with sensitivity and conversation.  Songs, chanting, drumming may form part of the activities in the space. As would storytelling, psychic readings, spontaneous 'mini-workshops' on the tarot, or meditation. At times people who feel uncomfortable due to drugs they have taken are attracted to this peaceful space. We are well versed in assisting them to get through a potentially difficult experience. We would be sure to maintain contact,  liaise, and cooperate with medical/security services at the festival, so that we would be better able to help those in need.  \nOverview of The Goddess Pond Experience\nThe Goddess Pond is an enigmatic metaphysical installation that began around 2004, when it was first introduced as a sacred space, by Robert Borecky in the Portal Stage, at the Shambhala Music Festival in Salmo, BC Canada.\nEach of the ensuing years, the site would be dedicated once again to the Goddess archetype and held as sacred space for attendees. The first High Priestess of the space, Paloma Vita, was a multi-lingual pagan Priestess. She acted as an intuitive counselor and offered Reiki healing to those in need. Others who helped maintain the sacredness of the space throughout the festival and throughout the ensuing years were deeply engaged in their personal spiritual practices. Dallas and David were invited to participate in the yearly creation and maintenance of The Goddess pond from 2010. Through the ensuing 5 years they reinforced the presence of the Goddess Spirituality archetype. \nPositive outcomes & Future \nattendees feel welcomed, loved, healed.\nCommunity building by inspiring others to create mutual respectful space.\nPervading an atmosphere of cooperative service and healing\nEncouraging respect for The Earth is central to Goddess Primary Spirituality, therefore people are encouraged to leave a smaller and cleaner footprint at a camping festival.\nModern Western Goddess Primary Pagan Spirituality is focused upon the celebration of human life on Earth. Beyond that precept it is open to any and all Earth and Humanity positive religions and spiritual practices. \nThe Goddess Pond is encouraging people to feel a heightened awareness or high through natural, meditative, and spiritual means. (without judgment) Not by “preaching”, rather by example and providing the space for new perspectives and paradigms to happen. \nAs a Transformational Festival, we feel it is significant that there be an acknowledgment of Spirituality, especially for young people to see that it is not only OK but maybe even socially positive to have a spiritual orientation and perspective.\nDallas and David are looking for Transformational Festivals to be involved in on a consistent basis. We bring our combined years of experience as a Priestess and Priest. We enjoy and appreciate conducting Workshops, such as “The Spiral Dance” and “The Middle Pillar Exercise” and many more. \nDallas and David have designed and conducted Opening and Closing Ceremonies at Shambhala Music Festival, Bass Camp, and other celebratory music events. They would be happy to cooperate with festival administrators, First Nations Holy Men and Women, artists, performers, and/or Yoga Practitioners,  to create an appropriate Opening and/or Closing Ceremony. \nArtist's Bio\nDavid Zunker - High Priest and Founder of Mystic Mountain Lodge - High Priest and Co-founder of Serendipity Celestial College\n In addition to my career in providing services to people with disabilities and those who are at risk of homelessness, I am an adult program presenter and public speaker. I have spoken to businesses as a promoter of The United Way Charities. I have been a speaker for unions that are involved in providing community services.\nI conduct classes in Tarot, Meditation, and Ceremonial Magic though local community centres, continuing education programs, and privately. I am an inner plane initiate Pagan Priest.   \nI presented workshops at the Museum of Anthropology \"Face to Face\" Conference, Shambhala Music Festival, The Gathering for Life on Earth, and at team building/training events for employers. \nI always provide a spiritual message with an element of humour and lightheartedness. \n\nReferences as a workshop presenter:\nEd O'Brien, Housing Coordinator  for The Victoria Cool Aid Society - eobrien@coolaid.org\nAngela Williams, HR Director Royal Museum of BC - aiwillia@shaw.ca\n\nDallas Mangnell - Black Cord Priestess of the 13th House Mystery School - High Priestess with Serendipity Celestial College\nDallas has moved through life circumstances to be the caring mother of two happy young adults. She has a career in government service, where she has been active in the union in support of her coworkers. Years of spiritual seeking brought her to her education and initiation with the 13th House Mystery School. This has been an established organization for Wiccan style training for over 20 years in Victoria. She brings superior non-violent communication skills, dedication, empathy, and caring to The Goddess Pond and her Workshops. \n\n\nWe have, also, proposed 2 other Workshops as Teachers.

        "bio": "Sam Cave is a 20 year old soul singer, songwriter and guitarist from the outback of Australia. Three months after graduating high-school, the teen left home on a solo adventure to the other side of the world in pursuit of experiences and knowledge.\n\nLiving a secure and easy life under the wing of his parents was something Sam did not approve of. Perhaps it was the fact that he was born an only child, but his craving for independence led him to live a life against the grain of social norms. Instead of celebrating his 18th birthday with an extravagant party, he chose to run around signing forms and taking photos to finalise his passport. Or when faced with the task of paying rent, he went busking 6 hours a day, 7 days a week in subway stations instead of relying on an employer.\n\nAfter travelling from east to west in Canada, Sam has found his home in Vancouver. The city’s focus on social and mental consciousness has been swallowed in large gulps and transformed into inspiration for him to write many songs, namely so, 'Just Breathe'. A catalogue of other songs are also at a ready to record state. \n\nDue to his motivated demeanor and eagerness to shake every hand, Sam has been presented with many opportunities and received plenty of support from the good friends he has made in the local Vancouver music scene. Experiencing this camaraderie has taught him that accepting help is okay, as long as you are working hard enough to deserve it.\n",

        "bio": "I M U R is a future soul duo from East Vancouver. With Mikey J Blige on live beat composition and electric guitar, and Jenny Lea on vocals and keys, the pair has the innate ability to not only reach their audience,  but pull them inside out, exposing parts of the soul and psyche often hidden.\n\nThe duo blends strength with vulnerability, and intimacy without inhibition. Sex, drugs, booze, self-doubt and heartache are ideas most often explored in their lyrics. Fitting, because I M U R’s sound is both seductive and addicting.\n\n“Drawing on electronic, hip-hop, jazz, neo-soul and progressive pop influences to build soundscapes that engage and enchant.  With intricately purposeful construction and a wondrously hypnotic aural magnetism, Blige provides the evocative sonic templates through which Lea threads the complementary emotional hues of her nonchalantly smoky, sultry vocal. Encompassing everything from bumpy percussion, glitchy shimmers and ruminative guitar licks through to lush key splashes, skittering hi-hats and wobbly synth flourishes, I M U R's signature sound is as eclectically fascinating as it is hauntingly resonant.\n\nEffortlessly harnessing the emotive interplay between instrumentation and vocals, the duo display an intuitive understanding of how tone and texture can evince a myriad of thoughts and feelings: from the desolate heartbreak, emotionally bruising self-recrimination and regretfully reflective melancholy of last year's debut 'Slow Dive' EP, through to the warmer, nod-your-head-grooves of more recent releases, as I M U R Blige and Lea prove with their genre-defying creativity that their vision for the 'future' is one that is here to stay.” - Next2Shine",

Which is why I have two projects, one that spreads the psytrance meaning. The other takes inspiration from all other forms of underground dance music (acid house, techno, IDM)(as well as listening) and comes out in a more hybrid format. A blend one would say.

        "bio": "I am a beatboxer (one of Canada's top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships), producer, and DJ. What I am offering is a one of a kind, unique performance merging live beatboxing with a high energy electronic set composed largely of my original productions! \n\nHere is my artist biography; \n\nIt’s hard to believe the music blaring through the speakers is coming entirely from his mouth; with that rattling bass, layered in perfectly timed beats and dimensional sounds. The melody is there, you get lost in the beat, and just fall along with the drop. Beatboxing at it’s finest. After all, you are only listening to British Columbia’s top beatboxer, and one of Canada’s top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships. It’s the perfect intro for the set he’s about to mix; a variety of tunes, including many of his own productions, sure to keep any crowd swimming hard through those sound waves all through the night. Chrizpy Chriz is a show you simply cannot miss; stage presence, personality and, of course, talent all up on one stage. He is well known through the interior of British Columbia having placed a lasting impression on the many crowds he’s provided with the gift of his sound art. You might have caught him rocking his decks at underground shows and festivals, including, but not limited to, Burning Man (NV, USA), Elysium (the Blue), Felurian Grove, Kicking Up Dirt, IUG Jamboree, Get Bananas, U4eeyah, and a spontaneous in-between performance at Envision (Costa Rica), opening for artists such as Snak the Ripper, Mark Instinct, Terravita, Mat the Alien, Meikulator (Perkulat0r and Alex Mei), Ill-esha, and Pigeon Hole. Headlining Cascadia NW (WA, USA) as part of the Future Perfect Events showcase, he shared the main stage with artists such as  Penny Wide Pupils, Kozmo, Willdabeast, Bleep Bloop, and Tipper. He’s also played shows in California and Washington, pulling in crowds , and performed right alongside the well known Micheal Winslow. His YouTube reputation is also not a disappointment, with an ever-growing following of over 1100 subscribers, over 300,000 views, and holding a partnership with Fullscreen inc. Chrizpy Chriz is a performance you won’t regret bringing to your stage or event. Prepare yourself for a show you won’t forget. \n\nAt events and festivals, Chrizpy Chriz offers beatboxing workshops. Suitable for all levels, learn the basics of beatboxing as well as more advanced techniques and sounds. You’ll also get to appreciate a short performance and there is always plenty of space to get any questions you may have answered.\n\nArtist Statement;\n\n\"I have fully immersed myself in the crazy world that is electronic music and the scene that come with it. Absolutely passionate about what I do, I have taken on music full time and am pouring myself into the ultimate creation of sound. I strive to create a positive vibe and keep a crowd dancing to an ever changing combination of beats and sound waves. One of my goals as an artist is to help merge the line between the electronic and the organic creation of sound.”\n\nI would just like to add a huge thank you for taking the time to review my application and take me into consideration for Blessed Coast 2016, I would be stoked for the opportunity to participate in this lovely event! I look forward to hearing back!\n\nMuch love,\nChris Gouchie",

It will already be at Astral Harvest and Revelation this year, and still confirming details with Zion Noiz and What The Festival but it should be making rounds there too!\n\nhttp://www.luna-artanddesign.com/spirit-guides.html\n\n\nArt Exposition;\nI would love to bring in my 2D work to expose, some of it is blacklight reactive, and I have prints, leggings and scarves that I would like to vend on which I would be open to working out a commission rate.\n\n\nHoop Performances;\nI can perform during DJ sets, I have an LED smart hoop for night-time performances. I have previously performed at Shambhala, Cascadia NW, and Elysium, and have Astral Harvest confirmed for this year as well. \n\n\nAlso open to potentially teaching hula hoop workshops!\n\nArtist Biography;\nLuna was barely five when her parents conveyed the concept of a \"job\" to her, and right then and there the answer already was \"an artist!\" Not many can say they've fulfilled their childhood dreams. In high school, she took art IB, did a two year pre-university program in visual arts and completed up to her second year at Emily Carr University before realizing that school wasn't for her. It was at this point in time that she set off on a journey with no other purpose than to experience, and it was then that she met her greatest of teachers, Mother Earth herself. Constantly inspired by the frantic, changing world by which she surrounds herself, Luna is always striving to create in new ways, new mediums, to share ideas and expand thoughts. To make you analyze the very fabric of life from another perspective.\n\n\nThank you so much for taking my creations into consideration for exposition at Blessed Coast! I would just like to add that my boyfriend has also applied to perform as a musician (Chrizpy Chriz/Chris Gouchie) which means that I would not require any travel coverage if he were to make it in as well (and, since I know you are small budget, I would actually be completely open to doing it only for sale profits on my artwork, since if he is in, I would be there either way!).

When they got the whole pub up on their feet later that night at the open mic, starting a band just felt right. The girls started playing the Vancouver circuit with original reggae, folk and country tunes. Known for infectious grooves, super-good vibes and great jams, G&M quickly grew to become a powerful mix of 7 talented ladies and 1 bad-ass dude rockin’ some of the sweetest, most intimate venues in Vancouver. Each Ginger & Moonshine member writes their own music, stretching the band’s range to encompass everything from dub and reggae to salsa, jazz, blues, rock/pop and folk. Rich 4-part harmonies, violin, trumpet and keys give G&M’s music a beautiful, unified sound that transcends genres and makes you feel good.",

        "bio": "\"Steven Sedalia is a singer-songwriter forging a sunkissed folk fusion sound with carefully constructed stories and symbolism seemingly carved by the river itself, using organic acoustic instruments, along with earth-tone percussion and a bright mantric vocal style, his conscious messages emphasize themes of Love, wonder, and connection to the Great Mother Earth. Being raised in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, and living in his current home base on the isle of Kaua’i, in the Hawaiian island chain, the beauty of nature is ever present in the songs, providing a template for stories of adventure, growing pains, and deep reverence for the Land. In the music is the story of all lives, an honest grounding and a ruthless determination to transcend. Sedalia infuses with his live performance, a firm and compassionate call for environmental justice action and support, and creates a dynamic, interactive conversation through crowd involvement in the performance. Playing alongside artists such as Nahko & Medicine for the People, Xavier Rudd, and Tubby Love, Sedalia's music helps to push along the greater conscious music movement. Layered with ancient symbolism created by close contact with the flesh of the earth, along with the cultivation of the traveler’s wide eyes, the songs share the gift of unflinching compassion.\"\n\n\"In addition to being touring musicians, Sedalia and friends are organic farmers in Hawaii. Infused in the music is their love for the land and a call for a healthy relationship with the land through directly inspiring listeners into a feeling of reverence for nature.

Writing songs from the age of 15 and keen on making a splash in the world with the charm of a young adolescent's heart, his writing initially touched on issues that weren't too far from his doorstep. \nEventually, he aired on the number one Jordanian Hit Music Station Play 99.6 with two of his songs, War Be Gone and Cannibal's Paradise.\n\nHis first recorded and distributed album Star In a Jar, was released in 2013. It marked his third batch of original material, which was an icebreaker for what followed in this singer-songwriter's public career. \nThis led to a London produced electronic EP and a second guitar based album, Seven Shades of She. A quick eavesdrop reveals hooks that are more raw and satisfyingly gritty. KAIS is certainly no stranger to wanderlust, which he considers essential to his songwriting. He has also pushed the boundaries of his spiritual development with an avid love for travelling, rock climbing and skydiving, and he aspires to combine it all with a world tour for his music.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that he has been musically active around Vancouver since moving back in December 2015, and has even performed at hallmark venues like Studio Records, The Wise Hall and the Harbor Event Centre. Meanwhile, he continues to hone his craft as a four-piece band for festivals and other signature venues such as The Biltmore, Fox Cabaret and the Commodore Ballroom.\n\nFuture plans for this artist include the recording of a third international album release and going public with a full-fledged music video in March this year. We await for him to keep unleashing new waves of flair and creativity.",

        "bio": "My name is Philip Auer and I am a passionate and ambitious up-and-coming musician who is interested in playing at your festival for 2017! I'll start off by telling you a little bit about my musical journey. \n\nI started playing classical piano from a young age and eventually fell in love with the instrument. I was then pulled into improvisation and jazz, and soon enough I began composing electronic bass music. I am now dedicating all my energy towards a music career and have just begun a jazz piano degree at Grant Macewan University. My vision is to combine the powerful sounds of electronic music with live piano into a combination which elates the dance-floor and inspires humanity.\n\nOver the last year, I have made many moves to advance my career. I released my first album titled 'The Vault' on December 2015, and have since released an EP titled 'Primal Waking' which features my best music yet (https://soundcloud.com/pauermusic/sets/primal-waking-ep). I played for the closing ceremonies at Astral Harvest last summer, so I have experience playing at festivals (link: music starts at 05:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FLB4or938&t=564s). I am a competent pianist and am constantly practicing to become the most well-rounded musician I can be (you can check out my instagram for piano clips: https://www.instagram.com/pauermusic).\n\nMy music could be described as deep rhythmic bass mid-tempo with strong chord progressions and ethereal soundscapes. The set I would throw at your festival would have 'thick midtempo vibes' most likely suited for night-time. Like I said, I am currently dedicating all of my energy towards becoming the best musician I can be, and I genuinely believe that my performance would bring something really special to this festival.",

Amble Greene is led by Cameron Gray and is considered a pseudonym for his solo project.\n\nThere’s a certain spin of english about the name, which only adds to truth, most of his music is inspired by British 60′s, and 70′s pop/rock/folk acts.\n\nAmble Greene was selected in Vancouver's Peak Performance Project top 20 in 2013. Cam is currently living in his van which he has converted into a make-shift recording studio, and has been actively supporting the decentralization movement in Vancouver.\n\nHe jokingly refers to himself as “solarpunk” for having futuristic gadgets, solar panels, wires and knobs housed in the shell of his 1981 V8 chevy funcraft. Believing music should transcend meaning into other mediums of communication, he is inspired by philosophy, technology, community, and sustainability, believing they're all integrated in one system.\n\nAmble Greene tries to tweak the traditional model of what’s expected of an act. Sure there’s showmanship, entertainment, but there’s also innovation, forward thinking and most importantly an intimate connection.\n\nCam has also begun construction on a tiny house that he’s building on a trailer. One day he hopes to live in this house and be able to record his own music at will. Ideally he would like to live sustainably, grow his own food and continue to explore this infinite world and its endless mysteries. \n\nHis end goal as an artist would be to inspire people to live differently and to become more conscious of the socio-economic problems that face our uncertain future.",

Their dynamic live shows are all about flowing grooves and heartfelt deliveries. Receiving airplay worldwide, their 4th album, “Like Gypsies”, was #1 on Lethbridge’s CKXU 88.3 FM and was also on Canada’s National Blues and Roots Chart. Starting in 1996 and covering ground from Whitehorse to the Mexican border, they’ve played over 3000 shows and just finished their sixth album, due to be released this February.\nKyler Schogen has shared the stage with Gordie Johnson, Long John Baldry, Northern Pikes, Doug & the Slugs, Warrant, Teenage Head, etc and their music is sold on itunes, Amazon, CD Baby...               \n\n\nKyler Schogen - Radio Play for “Like Gypsies”, 4th album. \n \n“Like Gypsies”, was played on stations across the country and was #32 \non  \"Canada Roots Radio Airplay Chart\", (counting national airplay), the week \nending July 26th, 2013. \nhttp://rootsmusicreport.com/index.php?page=intchart&country=CANADA\n \n...and was #1 on Lethbridge’s CKXU 88.3 FM the week ending July 30th, 2013.\nhttp://www.earshot-online.com/charts/ckxu.cfm?intChartTypeID=7&dWeekOfID=2013-07-30\n\nThe band has also gotten airplay on Kamloop’s CFBX  92.5 FM syndicated, \n“At The Crossroads” show , which had, “Like Gypsies”, at # 9 on the blues chart for September 2013.\n\n\nPress Clippings:\n\"Kyler Schogen played soulful music for the crowds attending...\" \n- Ian Kucerak, Edmonton Sun (Oct 09, 2011)\n\n\"(CD Review of \"Pocket Fulla Nothin'\", SunCave Records - May 1/2011.) Kyler Schogen hits a \nsweet spot musically, that area just where rock, blues and folk converge. It is a place which \nmusically, is almost ideal, at least to my ears, a devout blues lover, who appreciates a good rock \nsong, and the lyrical strength of folk. It's a crossover locale others have visited, some making it their musical home. Schogen should certainly make it his residence since he is clearly at home in this neighbourhood. The end result is a pleasing CD, an effort worth lending an ear to, just maybe regularly.\" \n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Jul 27, 2011) \n\n\"Kyler Schogen headlined the evening, (Springtime in Alberta Festival, Hayloft Acres). The band played an original set and captivated the crowd with thought provoking lyrics and hooky melodies from their new CD, \"Pocket Fulla Nothin'\". They rose above an evening chorus of mosquitoes and frogs to wow an appreciative audience. \"\n- Karen Pedlar, Smoky Lake Signal (May 25, 2011) \n\n\"(Review of \"Electric Life\" - Kyler Schogen, SunCave Records. Released March 1/ 2009.) Schogen is actually a veteran blues man, having recorded several CDs since the mid-1990s with his own band. The music is that sort of good-timing blues which gets the toes tapping. The music has the sad side of life lyrics, but the music suggests tossing the negativity and having some fun. Schogen does a good job of offering up that take on things. A fun blues CD disk for a summer drive.\"                \n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Sep 01, 2010) \n\n“Starlight Dreams is a well-composed collection of songs that will certainly take the listener on a journey as it fuses a bluesy approach with Spanish and Latin sounding melodies.”\n- Alan Kausy, Smoky Lake Signal (Aug 26, 2015)\n",

I run a laptop free set up, relying on hardware sequencers, synthesizers, drum machines, and samplers to make all my noise.  There's a lot of activity in my performance - never a dull moment. I also sing live. My lyrics are rooted very much in the Pacific Northwest - well, there and in space. \n\nIn the past 2 years I've played over 50 shows - all the way to Winnipeg and back, but for 2017 I'd really like to focus on sharing my music with more people in our little corner of the world ( I'm close by in Powell River). My wife and I also just really want to come to Blessed Coast :).\n\nMy most recent album, Inner Space Odyssey, came out in October 2016. It made the National Earshot! Electronic Chart in December as well as a bunch of individual station charts. It was reviewed in BC Musician Magazine, Nooga.com, NeuFutur magazine to name a few. A new music video from the album was just premiered by Paste Magazine http://bit.ly/2lAhqoW\n\nFor streams / DLs, bio, album one sheet head to my private (no sharing please) EPK at http://press.badabuzz.com/textureandlight\n\nMy remixes (closer to what 2017's live set is shaping up to be like) can be heard here: https://soundcloud.com/textureandlight/sets/remixes\n\nSpeaking of live: the live version of T&L has been everything from a 5 piece to a 3 piece to a duo, but for 2017 I'm re imagining it as a solo \"live Pa\" act. The new direction makes my live set more dance floor friendly and allows me to incorporate my remixes into my set among other things. It also makes it a lot more seamless between songs.\n\nWait, there's more!\n\nI have a festival workshop \"Live Electronic Music Without A Laptop\" that I've hosted in the past that I'd be happy to share if you were interested. Also, before T&L I was a deep tech house DJ (Trevor Refix) for 10 years (including holding a residency in the Fractal Forest at Shambhala in 2005/6) so I'd consider doing a DJ set on top of a T&L performance too if it made sense.

I believe our music is a good match for the spiritual focus of Blessed Coast. \n\nIn lieu of a website, which we don’t have yet, I entered below a YouTube video of an excerpt of one of the “easier” pieces we performed last summer in Squamish. I have other samples if you are interested. \n\nPlease note that this is not a “drum circle” open to audience drum participation. A drum circle is something we could hold separately from this if you are interested. \n",

A third mic could be used for my brief talking before numbers. Individual drums do not need to be microphoned.\n",

Recent revelations have aided me to highlight this important intention for my 2017 festival tour. If I could carry only one message through my art it would be this simple but powerful verse:  “Inspire Love”  To your Neighbor, your friend, your son your daughter , the stranger you shared a smile with!  We all seek and aspire towards a positive epiphany at this particular cross road.     Through live art, self expression is a well loved journey both inwards and outwards!  Ineffable benefits are abound for the artist and beholder! What improv painting unfolds on my canvas further reflects another facet of my inner self.. Perhaps even a cue to the next path on my vision quest.   My past esteemed artworks have held upmost detail to a ethereal theme, and through this artistic style I envision my further transcendence in art.  Baby blue, pink and mint, a splash of black white, rainbow.. 8 years experience, and with each year passing my talent progresses; the best is only yet to come! I am more than excited to offer for 2017 “Inspire Love”  Live art by Rae Vena  \n Otherworldly, at first glance, a jumbo flower hangs down, art nestled between its petals.. A round canopy hangs from above, each pastel petal flows gently in the wind revealing its inner artful purpose. Inside, a nest of rugs & pillows surround an intimate exhibit of surreal art . In the center a blossoming live art painting takes host ! My art environment is part installation, part performance -for this is where my live art magic will take home for the weekend. By nightfall the glimmer of lights further invite observers to explore the art locus. Eclipsed by day, luminescent night sky will glow with curiosity on the inside floret. A live art hub,  where you can meet the artist, see the process and of course share space with others in creative conversation. This project is designed & will be handmade using as many up-cycled materials as possible. The top of the canopy is pvc tubing attached to roped pulley system. Pastel fabrics will be cut & sewn into the petals, then fitted with a bottom casing for water resistance. This canopy is decorative as well as useful for protection against rain, or simply roping off the art & displaying a \"closed\" sign during off hours for dancing! The essential benefit of hosting a space throughout the weekend is that guests can periodically visit to see an ongoing live art exhibit. Plans include fabricating a lock box for paints & tools of my trade & create a secure free standing wall from repurposed materials. If my timeline and costs doesn't permit the build of these extra elements, a heavy based easel will be secured  & a patio umbrella used as a base for my live painting. My installation is best suited under a tree to easily hang the canopy from above, if necessary a free standing method can be implemented with the patio base. I suggest distance of 30 meters or less to available electricity, and placement within earshot of a stage for musical inspiration! Thank you for joining me in celebrating my dedication in creation, for this unique festival exhibit  ~ Inspire Love , Blessed Coast 2017! ",

I will make a welcome sign at the entrance to help people get to know this 4,000 year old practice that is found around the world in many different rituals and religions. The labyrinth will be set up and open all weekend (lines created with fabric layed out, maybe small stones, contained candles at night etc.) which I am willing to steward, monitor and maintain. I am also called to offer one/two time slots where the bowls will be set up and people can sit with me (in small group or one-on-one) before they walk to explore the different ways to Find deep purpose or intention in this dynamic meditation. This will be by signup or walk in (which ever suites the space/time best). When people are ready to enter the labyrinth with their new found intention and way of walking, I will play the Crystal Choir (crystal bowls, lyre, chimes etc) to allow for deep openings through the SoundSeed Medicine as they walk to centre and back out again. \nEither an installation for the entire weekend if we find an appropriate space, or at the main stage at sunset one night and i will create it for the use of 1.5/2hrs with candles, fabrics and offer a short description and play and invite people to walk for the duration of that time then take it down again. \n\nDescription: This mystical ritual, thousands of years old, is a metaphor or one's journey to the centre of understanding. The Labyrith is a sacred space, like the medicine wheel, and a universal symbol of peace. It is a pattern with purpose, an ancient tool that speaks to a long forgotten part of us. Lying dormant for centuries, labyrinths are undergoing a revival for use and interest. They offer a chance to take 'time out' from our busy lives, to leave schedules and stress behind. Walking its path is a gift we give to ourselves, leading to discovery, insight, peacefulness, happiness and sometimes tears, connectedness, and well being. \nThe Labyrith will be set up and open to walk any time all weekend, with ceremonial opening (friday time) and official closing (Sunday evening time). Please join for these specific times as well. There will be opportunity on (Saturday/sunday morning or afternoon -suggested 10am-1pm or 1pm-4pm) to explore 'The Labyrinth Walk: Finding the Sounds of Self.' In this dynamic meditation, Ocian with SoundSeed Medicine Journeys will help participants find intention and way of walking and then play crystal bowls and other instruments while you walk creating a beautiful unique soundscape as you walk the path to centre and back into the world again.

        "bio": "I am performing live painting, not on canvas, but rather on a person, a Devin nude body, and using henna as my medium - natural body art (temporary tattoos). \n\nThis live painting installation would start at sunrise near a music stage and end at sunset (to mimic the time of fasting for Muslims during the sacred month of Ramadan). I would cover the Devin body with traditional Arabic henna motifs prominent in Muslim culture and used for religious holidays and sacred unions such as weddings. And when the henna has dried and crumbled off, the skin will be stained with the motifs and will remain stained for several days.   \n\nThe concept of this live body painting installation is to intentionally juxtapose the two worlds that I come from - My Moroccan heritage, an Arabic culture which relies heavily on its conservative religious customs, and my French Canadian heritage - a very liberal, open-minded and free spirited realm. My questions in this installation are - What is sacred? What is forbidden? And why? What is the meaning of sacred? Where are the limits of beauty, divinity and blasphemy? And so I draw from these questions as I make my own lines from my heritage on a Devin nude body for all to see. \n\nI see divinity as a presence that is always there, and is either blocked and hidden or shining and flowing on to share and touch others. In this installation, the concept of staining skin for several days gives life and longevity to the art, as it will remain a shine and persist when I, the artist, has stopped “painting”. Its is a moving installation, living, breathing, dancing, and ever changing, as the tint will fade after several days, and as the Devin body tans, sweats or freckles from the sun. \n\nThis is an original instillation, so I don't have a website showcasing my work, but I have attached my Pinterest page where I draw my inspiration of henna designs.

Noetik was quickly drawn to beat making for lyricists and underground events. While dedicating his life to Hip Hop culture Noetik became strongly influenced by breakbeat, world music and future bass. In the process of creating new genres of music, anchored by the back bone of Hip Hop, Noetik relocated to the California Bay Area in 2010. After being submerged into West Coast Bass Music, Noetik began making music to compliment his recordings of tablas, wood winds, berimbaus and various world instruments.

It brings up insecurities, values, expectations, conditioning, suppressed emotions, memories etc. Many tools work similarly, but, as a musician, songwriting and music production are my preferred methods. My album is a manifestation of my inner process and the drop of inspiration that I hope will ripple from my inner being, out through my music, into my behaviour, through my interactions and out into my community. \n\nThe profound influence parents have on their children during their cognitive development has illuminated my understanding of how we influence everyone around us and how we are constantly shaped by our relationships and social interactions. As a privileged, educated, young woman I feel a personal responsibility to critically self-reflect and become conscious of the ways in which I interact with and influence others.\nI am not a mother, but I am an artist, and I know that art—in my case music—has tremendous power to emotionally touch, inspire and affect others. It is a community builder and a powerful language. I use this language to communicate my truth, attract like-minded individuals, deeply and intimately connect with myself and others, and thereby build community.\nI want to live in a healthy community with a healthy culture where individuals are free to be themselves, where people’s experience and expression are validated and pursuing self-actualization feels safe and supported. I have set out to seed such a community through music: through creative collaboration and through personal as well as interpersonal shadow-work. By recording my music, which reflects my values and my vision, I am planting a seed for a collaborative community around me. I feel pregnant with a culture, and I am motherly committed to nurturing it and bringing it into this world.\n\nMy songs are inspired by my own experience and the core messages are often about truely looking at our values. I express my own values such as care for the environment, family, love and gratitude for all the mothers and lifegvers, and I sometimes make little social commentaries about the society we live in, yet all with a flowy, dancy feel. \n\nI play my live sets with a violinist, another gutar player and a beatboxer. The sound is simillar to the album but has a slightly folkyer vibe. \n\n\nBlessings,\n\nBarbora Ravensdaughter\n",

        "bio": "Hello Blessed Coast!\n\nOver the past two years we have been busy carving out a niche for ourselves in the west coast underground bass/house music scene as one of the only male-female/couple DJ/Production duo's around. Known for our undeniably contagious, high energy sets, teamwork on the decks, and deep wobbly rolling basslines; we have gained a large following and an expectation to always deliver a top notch performance. With over 70 shows and 8 music festivals in the past year alone, we are starting to capture the attention of a global audience. We've have played several shows in the Southern California region and toured in the US, Spain and Mexico.\n\nNot only do we spend countless hours refining our mixing skills, but we also produce our own tracks. With an ear for the music, the transition into production was natural. We have already released 6 original tracks and 2 remixes in our first year of producing, 3 of which were signed to record labels (MalLabel Music, Helitricity Records, Sheppard Records).  Our first Beatport release in January 2017, 'Hot Boi' charted in the Top 100 Indie Dance/Nu Disco Releases, reaching spot #4. We are currently producing our first album :) \n\nOur music can be described as bouncy, 4 to the floor beats, characterized by pretty melodies and deep, wobbly, rolling basslines; heavily influenced by hip hop and the underground bass house music scene. The love and passion we have for our craft and for each other is undeniable and transcends everything we do! Specializing in Wobble House, G House, Tech House, and Brazilian Bass.\n\n\n",

My wife (singer/rapper) and I now share a beautiful 17 month old daughter, Naevia, and we have been trying to find something just like this to include her in. We would love to be a part of your growing gathering and see what its all about! Below is my career in a nutshell. \n\nOfficial bio:\n\n2-time Vancouver Island Music Award winner and WCMA nominee ‘Immaculate’ has pursued his life passion - writing, recording, producing and performing profanity-free hip-hop – for close to 15 years. Although his tastes and styles have evolved, his dedication to creating high quality, meaningful tracks that speak directly to his audience, has never wavered.\n\nConsistent, creative effort and collaboration has paid off. Immaculate has earned his reputation as a strong live performer having toured across 8 countries with established names including Machine Gun Kelly (MGK), Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Apathy and Celph Titled (the Demigodz) and Zion I and rocking festivals like Center of Gravity, Keloha, Hidden Music Festival, the Groove, YAA fest and the Golden Sound Festival and warming up audiences for numerous established names such as A$AP Rocky, Three 6 Mafia, Xzibit, M.O.P, Masta Ace, Wu-Tang, Souls of Mischief, Bliss n Eso, Warren G, Swollen Members, Shad, Illy, Zion I, Classified, Madchild, Sweatshop Union, DL Incognito, Moka Only, Emotionz, Kyprios, Sonreal, Snak the Ripper, Evil Ebenezer and many more.\n\nThe critically acclaimed rapper has also developed a solid buzz with the sales of thousands of copies of his 6 solo albums, his music charting on college radio, and winning several songwriting competitions. Immaculate has 6 official music videos one of which earned him a BCIMA nomination for 'Video of the Year'. Other critical recognition came when he was named ‘winner’ for his track ‘Destructive Behavior’ (reaching over 25,000 plays in it's first week) in an International song contest hosted by Life and Death Productions of Finland where he competed against hundreds of entries from around the world. Immaculate won first place in another world-wide collaboration contest for “Who’s the Illest” hosted by Arizona's Cryptic Wisdom and also made it to the finals of both the 2014 and 2015 Unsigned Only competition with over 10,000 submissions from over 100 countries.\n\nHis sixth independent release ‘Solitude’ highlights a new depth and maturity in his writing and production and features powerful tracks drawing from a recent family tragedy exemplifying the growth of an artist reinventing himself with every song.\n\nImmaculate has emerged as a significant voice in hip-hop – a voice well worth listening to.\n",

They are a Montreal based neo-soul electro jazz-funk trio, fusing heavy synths and live looping with organic instruments and hip-hop vocals. I'd like to submit an official application for Blessed Coast for 2018.\n\nHere is what Peter North, artistic director of the Salmon Arm Roots & Blues Festival had to say about us last year during our three month cross-Canada tour:\n“There’s a loft somewhere in the Tower of Song for these three. This “glitch-hop” trio is an example of what happens when you move from Vernon to Montreal with a groove surplus: boom, drummer. The Force connection between Marina on the synth machines and Orion on guitar allows Varoujan to jedi around on the kit pretty much at will, to wondrous ends. Or maybe they’re from the 27th century and it just looks like magic.”\n\nBelow are links to two of our most recent live videos. We have many more on our YouTube channel as well. By summer 2018 we will have released our third full-length album.\n\nEvent Horizon:\nhttps://youtu.be/a1xuuuFjU8Q\nImminent Light:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOAJ4uySTcc\n\nOfficial website: www.theomsound.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/theomsound\n\nEPK: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx07RBDH0-p_UnZZVWEtdVY2b2c?usp=sharing\n\nIncluded in our EPK are promo images, stage plot, three lengths of biography, performance history, reviews, and more.\n\nWe also offer Creative Improvisation and Live Music Yoga workshops.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you!

        "bio": "Hi. I'll paste my bio below this, but first I'll just fill you in from my brain right now: I make and perform what I call \"electronic music from inner space\". In my live set I use synthesizers, drum machines, and samplers to build my groove, and then I sing over top. My music does well outside as it's heavily inspired the West Coast life I live in the woods and on the shores. It's in the 90 bpm range so it can fit well in an environment where people are laying down looking at the sky or as a set under the stars that people go off to. I certainly get into the sweaty dance moves while I perform... My vibe is one that's authentic to me - hopeful and introspective lyrics with music that's a bit more gritty and dark (though there are some pretty twinkly synth sounds too). \n\nTexture & Light is my priority, but I also DJ deep acid and tech house (as Trevor Refix) so that's always an additional option if I'm booked for a T&L set. I held a residency in the Fractal Forest many moons ago before I got seduced into the live PA / synth world :).\n\nI have a festival workshop called \"Live Electronic Music Without a Laptop\" that I could offer. It's basically a hands on demo of my live set rig with q + a and chatting. This past fall I was also part of a round table at Woodstove Festival called \"Artists Talk Anxiety\" that I really, really loved. I would be totally down to help facilitate something like that at Blessed Coast if that was of interest to you :). \n\nBio:\n\nTexture & Light was formed by DJ Trevor Refix as a way to explore live instrumentation, synthesis, field recordings, and deep themes, while striking a balance between the dance floor and headphone day dreaming.\n\nTrevor allows his music to lead him where it may, not putting much thought into staying inside a certain genre or following a certain formula. This is simply the music that Trevor was born to make, and it continues to evolve over space and time as he is carved by experience, joy, sadness, and wonder.\n\nRecently, Trevor has been inspired by ambient techno, nature, inner space, and the idea of authenticity. His current productions and live shows are built around the idea of bringing listeners on a fuzzy, deep, slow motion journey that takes place on a dance floor beneath the stars, but leads you deep within yourself.

Effortlessly combining elements of Drum & Bass, Hip Hop, Jungle and Footwork, their music is a perfect representation of all that is right with underground dance music.The iconic melodies and depth in their work is evident in their sound, which ranges from tough badboy swagger to smooth dubby grooves. Their first release came in 2016 with the \"Samhain EP\" on Black Tuna Recordings, followed by their \"Diamonds EP\" on Aufect Recordings that received support from Ivy Lab, Dexta, and Doctor Jeep to name a few. Next came their tune \"Wise Guy\" that was included on the \"Modern Soul 2\" compilation for Vandal Ltd. followed shortly after by a remix of Doctor Jeep's \"TX\" on Aufect. In less than a year following their first release, their track \"The Legend\" came out on Hospital Records' compilation \"The Future Sound of Canada.\" Be sure to keep it locked on Levrige for big releases and collaborations on the horizon.",

        "bio": "Lozen is a VIMA nominated artist who has a knack for captivating listeners with diverse musical tastes. Her collage of lyrical rap flow and smooth vocal melodies over criss-crossing genres has earned her a loyal tribe and expanding fan base. Lozen exudes an energy that is both raw and authentic. Live shows have evolved her unique approach to Hip Hop while recordings have pushed her sound across the globe.\n\nLozen's success sparked when she teamed up with Bombastic Jam Label boss and funk producer Basement Freaks (Hamburg, Germany). Bootyfunk (2011) garnered a significant amount of online press, reaching No#3 on junodownload.com and racked up hundreds of thousands of plays on\nsoundcloud.com with the overwhelming public response received from the \"Records in the Crate\" single remix competition. Lozen was able to keep the momentum going with Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON) releasing Tragedy & Triumph Mixtape (2012) which ranked No#10 on the National Hip Hop Charts.\n\nAfter opening for roster of heavyweights including De La Soul, Blackalicious, The Beatnuts, Masta Ace and Swollen Members it was time to hit the road. Touring with Kyprios and Animal Nation fueled the fire and the next collaborative project was born. Shake It Up (2014) was produced by Animal Nation and released via Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON), reaching No#6 on the National Hip Hop Charts and No#37 on CMJ USA Top 40 Hip Hop.\n\nWith a number of successful releases under her belt, headhunters have begun noticing Lozen’s refreshingly dynamic style. After spending several years refining her craft, this self-professed lyrical warrior has undoubtedly matured into an innovative new-school leader. Performing at world-renowned festivals; Envision 2015 (Uvita, Costa Rica), Shambhala Music Festival 2013 & 2010 (Nelson, BC) Lozen is quickly becoming a household name. Now achieving notable emcee status, add DJ and guitarist to the mix. Lozen's on the fly off the cuff spirit shines through when performing on stage. She has a way of connecting with her audience by bringing people together. The credo: Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.\n\nOne of the reasons you can’t take your eyes off her is your ears. Soulful, yet gritty. Lighthearted, yet deep. Her work ethic and passion has earned her residency at nightclubs and radio shows, reaffirming why she remains a buzzworthy artist who grabs your attention. She’s positive proof that the industry doesn’t need to be resurrected; it just needs a woman’s touch every now and then.",

[from my Mixcloud bio]\n\nEver since attending and volunteering at Blessed Coast last year I've wanted to play a set there.  So I just did a little mix inspired by the thought of playing at this year's event.  I was actually imagining the set in the late morning or early afternoon before the regular programing begins.   (If I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember the music only starting in the afternoon at some point..?).   Anyway, I'll leave that up to you ;-)  The mix is called Innaspace (ie. Inner Space) on my Mixcloud page (please see link below).   Listening notes: atmospheric, warm, hypnotic, funky, sun infused..  I hope you like it.\n\nPeace!\n\nGeorg",

        "bio": "Sarah Wheeler\nBiography\n\n\"One of Vancouver's punchiest indie singers.\"  Fish Griwkowsky, Edmonton Sun\n\nSarah Wheeler is queer artist and recent cancer survivor who is defined by power house vocals and an indomitable positive spirit.  A blazing live performer.  Although she has enjoyed collaborating with other musicians, lending her vocals to recordings such as “A Small Wonder” by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and sharing the stage with artists including Dan Mangan and Tanya Tagaq, this Vancouver-based artist has consistently remained focused on writing and performing her own music.  \n\nStuart Derdeyn from The Province reviewed Wheeler’s work by saying, “this is a very solid effort from an artist who has always had it but really tapped the right points and doesn't miss here”.\n\nLife changing experiences inspired Wheeler’s upcoming unreleased album Revival.  Having been diagnosed with cancer and undergone treatment that kept her from performing for a year, Sarah wrote much of what would become her newest album during that time.  Wheeler wrote, performed, produced and recorded all of the songs for Revival, giving it a perspective that is uniquely homemade.  The result is a collection of songs with an unforced honesty and message of positivity through dark times. \n\nWheeler’s musical heritage was handed down to her through her grandfather’s pioneering efforts as a jazz pianist in local Vancouver clubs during the 50’s and 60’s.  In that period he backed jazz greats including Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr.  Sarah's mother had music in her blood.  She started teaching Sarah to sing before she could walk, and raised her in a household amidst the sounds of classic rock n roll, blues, jazz, and country music. Growing into a seasoned recording artist has been a natural progression for Sarah.  In the present day pop culture climate of false celebrity, Sarah is an old fashioned believer in remembering that the true power of music is the love of it.  \n\nSarah Wheeler is a third generation Vancouver born Canadian singer/songwriter who has leant her vocals to recordings such as “Don’t You Think We Should Be Closer” by Edmonton's Mark Davis of Old Reliable, and played live with artists including Mike McDonald of Jr. Gone Wild and The Be Good Tanyas.  None of which means anything without something to say.  Wheeler’s new album is a true Revival.\n\nSarah Wheeler has an \"effortlessly big voice which falls somewhere between Chrissie Hynde and Neko Case.\"-Adrian Mack The Georgia Straight\n",

One of the world's first international touring female loop artists, Mihirangi of Ngāti Rākeiora, Ngāti Waikorara, Ngāti Rāhiri and Ngāti Raukawa is a musical master in the art of songwriting & live-looping.\n\nMama Mihi is a songstress who has a tool-box full of musical magic; weaving live loops of vocals, intricate harmonies, tāonga puoro (traditional instruments), guitar, keyboards, world percussion with beat-boxing, drums and earth shaking bass lines with lyrics that melodically and poetically speak to indigenous and environmental issues. Supported by the dance, vocals and performance of her Māreikura the show is a colourful event of traditional and contemporary Māori culture celebrating the power and talent of our Māori women.\n\nAn artist-activist and a born entertainer, Mihirangi’s naturalness, infectious laughter and her authenticity means she doesn’t take herself too seriously. The refreshing aspect of her performance is the love and joy she has of live-improvisation and spontaneous crowd participation, her fearlessness and inclusivity draws her audience into the heart of her performances and into to the spirit of the magic she creates.\n\nThe Māreikura, recognized as female supernatural beings with noble whakapapa, genealogy, are Rita Peihopa of Ngāpuhi & Tiana King of Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairoa, Ngāti Whatua and Te Rarawa. Both who have been fully immersed in the Maori language and cultural revitalisation movement, and have an exceptional love of all things Māori to include both traditional & contemporary song & dance. Our Māreikura are both competitive kapahaka traditional performers and teachers of their language, culture and haka. Rita is a highly talented in traditional poi and mau-rākau, Māori weapons & martial arts. Tiana is a stunning and passionate contemporary Māori dancer, with a background in haka theatre and contemporary dance. Together the girls have performed on many festival stages and have professionally competed regionally and nationally for Te Taha Tu, a traditional Maori Performing Arts group.\n\nThis is the first year that Mihirangi’s new show “Mama Mihi & the Māreikura” are touring internationally and already the year is nearly booked out for the Commonwealth Games, Europe, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n“We’re taking this new show on the globe circuit to inspire the positive changes that we must make as a human family and we do this through sharing our traditions in a contemporary way that celebrates indigenous values that honour our relationship with Papatuanuku - Mother Earth” Mama Mihirangi.\n\n\n\n“She's just brilliant... in the 30 years I've toured the world I've never seen anything like her\" Ali Campbell UB40\n\n\"...infectious joy oozes from her very being, and captured our hearts... one of the most exciting, original and conscious solo performers of Australasia... an honour to watch” The Agency Victoria Australia\n\n“Her commanding presence will have you spellbound” NZ Herald\n\n‘The world is full of musical prodigies, but Mihirangi’s got them all beat: Between her appetite for musical adventure, her Māori roots, and her political convictions, she's the perfect model of a 21st-century shaman and star” The Georgia Straight - Vancouver\n\n\"One of the best things I've ever seen hands down... just mind blowing... there's some kind of transformative shifting thing going.” Jason Kerrison OpShop\n\n\"Unbelievable... from the beginning to the end, a super star... just mesmerizing.” Rachel Hunter",

Exploration kits include include handheld cassette recorders, a schematic of the site, mission guidelines, and a field notes template (-- the location of recording, time of recording, description, and the duration of the recording). Sonic collaborators may present their own sonic footprint gathering devices. CEEM nomads (i.e., other  artists) may tether their gear to Cosmo’s to intercept and co-mingle sonic signals. Conversely, Cosmo may appear momentarily to capture sonic footprints at other key programs. Cosmo classifies, archives, and curates sonic fingerprints in preparation for a Telemusic performance which incorporates all on July 28th or 29th. Sunset and sunrise are beautiful times to perform the Blessed Coast Chamber Movement. I would wish to transform the work into a recording to recontribute. *I have an all ages CEEM workshop as well that I will also apply for. ",

It is often their first contact with the playfulness of oil paints. For some it is a beautiful discovery. For others it is a deep exploration of themselves.   Sometimes, experimented painters come to put their touch! I smoothly direct the activity so the people can learn and have fun at the same time.\n\nIt is an always renewed discovery of how the music, the brush, your body and soul come to dance with the paint.\n\nSince I've been running this setup for while now I've acquired a lot of ''painting in parties'' experience.

The Blooming feeds their voyaged atmospheres into their strong structures whether it be the tempo of coastal lapping, or places that beckon to be remembered. The Blooming’s performances are immersive and enthralling. They evoke both the delicate and the overwhelming and have begun to incorporate sound healing practices into their performances. When listening to their songs one will hear poetic translations of journeys and history. The Blooming’s music incorporates peculiar soundscapes throughout their compositions. For example, the song “Sun-Eyed” uses a healing tuning fork. \n\nHaving played numerous festivals this past summer, such as Koksilah Music Fetival and Nootka Sounds Festival, The Blooming will be recording music in early 2018. Their goals for 2018 are to perform around British Columbia as well as to become export ready.

Based on the work of Tantric Guru Bhagavan Shanmukha Ananda Natha of Shri Kali Ashram (a traditional Tantric ashram preserving the Kaula tradition of Kashmiri Shaivism), this series of paintings explores the deeper meanings of the Divinities as metaphysical principles of existence. Each painting is accompanied with a written interpretation providing an interactive, experiential process of initiation for the viewer into the mythos of Traditional Tantra. Bhagavan Shanmukha's book, the Divine Initiation is an esoteric de-coding of the vedas, and this collection of paintings is a visual interpretation of that de-coding. A spiritually based work of art to inspire the highest forms of self realization as the Limitless Boundless Infinite One.\n\n",

Time Nomads is a natural extension of my previous work, Global Nomads, a photo series dedicated to leaving countries better than found. It intends to explore two prominent issues in Canada:cultural identity and mental health. \n\nThe concept is for festival attendees to:\n1. Pick up a blank postcard from the “Open Here” side of the mailbox\n2. Capture their elevated and euphoric thoughts and immortalize it in the postcard\n3. Include their own mailing addresses\n4. Put it in the “Drop Off” slit of the mailbox (locked to secure privacy)\n\nI will then send out the uplifting messages back to them 6-8 months later when Seasonal Affective Disorder and other mental illnesses are heightened. Once more, by the time the postcards are mailed back to the attendees, it will be a great reminder to purchase their passes for Blessed Coast Festival 2019! ;) \n \nWhile the message will serve as an uplifting reminder of sun-kissed joy in the dead of winter, it also holds a deeper meaning. Every year, 1 in 5 Canadians experience a mental health or addiction problem, and 10-15% experience mild to clinical forms of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Mental disorders and substance abuse often go hand in hand, and can affect our thought processes, causing us to focus on our current misery and forget the times we felt great or even normal. Time Nomads is a harm reduction tool that attempts to link our good past experiences to our future mental health.\n\n",

The “Open Me” side will be unlocked with blank postcards and several markers for festival goers to use, while the “Drop Off” side will be locked with a slit to allow completed postcards to be deposited.
