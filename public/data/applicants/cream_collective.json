He has released freestyles on platforms such as mixtape madness, as well as created his own music videos in which he has promoted across his social media platforms. Since his latest single Strandz has had interviews from large urban music platforms such as Guap magazine and Capital Xtra.",

I also think Strandz sound is familiar but new to the UK music scene, and people seem to be very receptive to his music. However I worry that he may not be as open to do other genres such as pop, I would want to see more versatility from him. ",
