As I mentioned to Brandon, I hope to do the first vinyl set again on Sunday this year and bring a church urn of coffee to serve with my set. After a Saturday night of getting down I figure I can set things off right with some good coffee and some java joints. 

I have done a mix that will be part of my set if you chose to have me play your festival. I would like to email you this set as I do not have all of the fancy press stuff you are requesting. I will reach out to Brandon about getting this to you all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,completed,2024-04-27 21:27,,2024-04-27 21:38,1f6893cb4b,

Dr.J began his life-long love of music in 1985 when he purchased his first vinyl LP – a copy of Grandmaster Flash’s “They Said It Couldn’t Be Done”. After amassing a sizeable music library, he bought his first DJ mixer in 1991 and started experimenting with mixing and scratching with an array of make-shift equipment and remnants from his mother’s record collection. October of 1994 marked his first public appearance as a DJ and he hasn’t looked back since. From his humble start doing small funk parties in his hometown Regina, to his hosting duties at the legendary Lydia’s  “Souled Out”(one of Canada’s longest running electronic music weeklies) he was able to make a name for himself as a respected DJ across North America. Dr.J currently holds numerous DJ residencies in Saskatoon, hosts the long running “Expansions” radio show, and is a contributing music writer for Hot Stuff magazine in the Netherlands.

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
