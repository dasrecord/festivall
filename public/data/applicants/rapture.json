Those two experiences showed my the technical/practical skills I would need to succeed as an Event Planner, but one of the most important skills that you can't teach is how to just have fun with it and be excited about what you're planning. I have found that when planning events, people can tell the day of if the event planner was really involved in the idea and passionate about every detail that went into it. And day-of, people at the event can tell whether or not the person who is running the show loves what they are doing. ",
        "ideal_party": "My idea of a great party would be lots of people who are there to dance, have drinks, and just all around have a great time. There would definitely be a dance floor right in front of some huge speakers/a DJ, (because I can't help but dance around while listening to good music.) An open bar would most likely be impractical, but also awesome. ",
        "social_sphere": "I haven't been as involved in social spheres as I would like to be this year but I do play soccer recreationally once a week.  ",
        "management_style": "I would describe my management style as pretty hands-off but relationship focussed. I think all my experiences with good and strong managers happened when I felt I could trust them and come to them when I needed help, but could also be independent and do things with my own spin, so I try my best to be that way when I manage projects or situations. I think that I could coordinate and encourage workers extremely well in a decentralized business model because I believe that people really excel when they know someone is rooting for them, and supporting them in the task they are doing, and not seeming unapproachable, demanding, and intimidating.

As a result, I have very solid foundations allowing me to understand all aspects of the decision making process. I have the unique ability to manage multidisciplinary projects and to navigate complex challenges. However, actual experience has taught me that my professional values are aligned with organisation, dedication & adaptability.\r\n\r\nI consider myself an articulate and self-motivated individual who draws on my ability to think analytically in order to exhibit leadership skills at all times. I pride myself on taking initiative, communicating in a variety of contexts, tackling business tasks hands on and thinking outside the box. I have exceptional oral communication and interpersonal skills with the ability to multi-task to ensure business requirements are successfully executed to a high standard.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of my Communications career, I have worked in Marketing Management and I have a dual degree in Business and Communications (Majors: Marketing and Public Relations) gaining invaluable experience in a number of industries both in Australia and London.\r\n\r\nI strive for personal excellence in all that I do and place great importance on continually developing myself both personally and professionally. My work ethic reflects that I am pro-active and a diligent individual who thrives on successfully implementing innovative business ideas and achieving corporate goals. My experience has allowed me to gain skills in organising and planning both people and a diverse range of campaigns and then ensuring the successful promotion of communication of key messages to target audiences.\r\n\r\nI have developed various skills including leading and managing teams, confidently problem solving at an executive level as well as directing professional strategies towards the profitable growth and operation of businesses whilst ensuring they reflect the longer-term objections and priorities.\r\n\r\nAny feedback about my professional demeanor has always been positive, in what may seem to be intimidating environments, particularly when dealing with staff, clients, the media and competitors. I have been acknowledged for maintaining integrity and dignity under fire whilst remaining competent, confident and always approachable, particularly with handling clients in turmoil.\r\n\r\nIf offered a position, I will continue my highest standard of enthusiasm that I have consistently displayed throughout my career and I will provide a positive attitude in everything I do.  I can be sponsored under the E3 Non Immigrant Visa, which can be easily arranged and requires no financial backing. \r\n\r\nPlease find attached a copy of my resume, which will give you a more detailed summary of my knowledge, experience and skills. \r\n\r\n  I look forward to the opportunity of discussing these further at interview and can be contacted on +61432 559  377 at any time.      \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,                Amber Diamond\r\n",

As a result of the UK education system, i felt it would be beneficial to take a gap year before starting my second year in university. In second year we have the option to choose business courses specifically in the field you are most interested in; therefore, before making a decision on what i want to major in, i felt it would be more practical to take a gap year and truly find out what my interests are .

I believe this is an essential quality to have when undertaking a position within a company as it is imperative to maintain quality team work and service delivery even with fewer members of staff. \r\n Having working in the Health and Safety/customer service environment for 15 years+ I am fully aware of the changing customer needs and the underlying importance of providing a professional image of a company at all times. My results are consistent and above targets and I pride myself on having impeccable organisational skills and the ability to address issues as and when they arise. \r\n Reporting to the CEO and UK Operations Managers, UK Health and Safety department to achieve a high standard of Health and Safety/Quality in all areas. Also to ensure the ongoing implementation of Health, Safety and Quality standards with all suppliers overseas, to ensure the FTO guidelines are adhered. Attending court claims when necessary to and to assist with the investigation of legal claims. \r\n My current as Director of Sales Marketing and pervious position of Head of Business Development has given me further insight into the operational side of the Events/Travel business and the necessary skills to manage varying roles. Combining this with experience gained from having worked overseas for nearly 11 years, I believe that I possess a sound understanding of the challenges a growing business may present. \r\n A position within your company will not only benefit my personal development but offer your company a sound quality individual who will work to ensure that the your company continues to deliver and achieve its targets for the coming year.",
