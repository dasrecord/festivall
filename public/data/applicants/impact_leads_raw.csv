Spurring this need for a new paradigm is the perennial, and often times, tragic issue of inequality on multiple levels, lack of freedom, a global pandemic, racial unrest, climate change, and a political and economic system that is in decay, sick, and dying.  The issues, challenges, and sickness found in our external world reflects the internal, collective consciousness, and sickness of humanity.

I believe Indigenous Consciousness is the way to a life in harmony!

Since the beginning of time, the nature of a human being is to walk a path of connection with the Earth. I call this path ""The original teachings"". 

These teachings are simple but powerful ways that teach us a healthy relationship with ourselves, with all living and also very importantly, with the spirit world. 

When we practice these sets of instructions we're able to gain a wider sense of understanding of our reality and thereby achieve higher levels of consciousness that will lead us to a conscious life of beauty.

Why you may fear taking chances on yourself? Why being vulnerable and asking for support is so hard at times? 

You are not alone. So many of us still fear our full self expression, and our gifts. In fact, most of us do and it being with the beliefs we created about ourselves and the world around us in our childhood. 

It can be hard to believe that those beliefs are still with us. The curious part is just how 95% of our actions are controlled by those very same beliefs. 

Join us, as we explore how to shift our core beliefs, so we can show up as our whole and authentic selves in the world today. We are ready to see female leaders embrace their fullness and step out. Especially those who are modelling the possibilities for future generations. 

In this workshop, we will dive into a 3 step process that will help you begin your own path towards discovering how old beliefs from your childhood may be running your adult life.

The workshop will run 90 minutes. Please bring with you a pen and paper. Everyone is welcome.","https://no, though our company site is www.raisinghumanity.com",,,,http://www.facebook.com/groups/raisinghumanityvillage (online community),https://company url instagram.com/raisinghumanity,,,"I have a long history in the growth and healing arena, with strong teachings in both the west and the east. Though much of my time was spent in corporate and then as an entrepreneur, on the treadmill, feeding into the patterns from my own inter generational patterns, my past experiences gave me exactly the perspective that has allowed me to step into a vision of supporting parents who feel stuck, with no way out of their pain, their doubt, their hurts that are then transmitted to their children. The parent-child relationship is at the root of all of humanity's sustainability, yet we tend to ignore our core healing in exchange for band aid solutions on the outside. So the invitation we bring forward is for parents to step into their truest life, their joy, and their freedom, so they can support their children in being their most authentic selves. Without this path being paved ahead, we will be sure to stay enmeshed in the vicious and painful cycles of struggle that are currently in as a humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, in person in Vancouver and online",1,Are your childhood experiences still running your adult life? 3 steps towards the path of re parenting.,Transformational/ Motivation,,,,,,https://wonderlives.org/balancing-act/,,90,,"Dr Madalina Petrescu (cardiologist, alumni of our signature program) +14256148415

I can perform complete sets of my own original music. Most of my tracks have original lyrics and vocals that I have co-written with local artists. I also believe my music reaches a high standard of quality, having had a nomination for 2017 Electronic Recording of the Year at the Edmonton Music Awards, FM radio play across Canada and the US on 110+ stations with many top 10 airplay chartings in the electronic genres, several Beatport Staff Picks, Top 10s, and a Featured Track, and features and interviews by reputable electronic music blogs like WeRaveYou.com. 

I am a highly motivated individual, working closely with several other well-respected artists and industry members. I recently launched an events company with Thug Shells (Michelle Leus) called Vibe Raiders, we had a successful Valentine's party and are planning 3-4 events per year. I am a crew member/resident DJ for FancyFoxx Music/The Womp and recently attended Amsterdam Dance Event conference with Frank Olaya and Adriana Briceno of MonkeyTwerk. I produce music with RamJamSam (Sam Eid) and our first original, ""There's a Rumor"" is being released on March 22, 2020. I do a few shows a year with Cheshire Productions in Edmonton. 

In addition I am also a practicing medical doctor with 5 years of specialty training in psychiatry, so I come with a unique perspective, being fully immersed in the the medical profession and mental health world, as well as decades of experience and involvement as a musician.

Mullin’s trip to the 2010 edition of Shambhala showed him how bass music could bring people together to create an unparalleled sense of community and euphoria in the same space. Returning home, Mullin began working towards creating tracks that captured this atmosphere, a goal that continues to remain central to his music a decade later. 

With Internal Frequency continually hitting new milestones on social media as bass heads from around the world take notice, he continues to foster the growth of his own community of followers with free releases, live streams, and layers of slow, hulking bass that channel the frequencies of the universe.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m6WO0PRPgI6XiuFzq6aO5FMCE4FLoj7a,https://soundcloud.com/internalfrequency/wobble-heart-beats,1,https://soundcloud.com/sublimated-sounds/internal-frequency-neural-assault-forthcoming-ssr049,https://www.facebook.com/InternalFrequency84,https://soundcloud.com/internalfrequency,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/5f06e919a3bb7e7ef25a74e2b6e01f24aeab9c651febcb858a291af224f9ec9b/IF_Wordmark_Blk.png,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/5950f7e19d36564a95216c95dd7f6a3b61244e633ea9646b3eb477a18e666077/InternalFrequency_Headshot_1_.png,"There are a couple reasons I believe I should be selected to perform at IMPACT festival. First and foremost is my dedication and passion towards music.  

Creating music is one of the few things in my life that I've broken through the wall so to speak.  With most things I've taken up I've been content with mediocre, with giving up on learning because it was too difficult, because the effort to progress was more than my desire to progress. With music and creating though I have an insatiable desire to learn and grow and in the process, pass on the knowledge I have gained to friends and people who reach out. I've had more 3-5 hrs of sleep nights in the last 5 years of this journey then not. I have a family the comes first and had a job before the quarantine and the only thing i was willing to sacrifice to learn music production was sleep. No matter how tired I am, how beaten down by the day I am, I move forward on my musical journey, even if it's just a step that day and if that's not passion I don't know what is.

The other reason I believe I should be selected to perform is the style of music I create. I believe my take on dubstep is unique and fresh. I blend elements of deep and heavy dubstep and combine them with lush melodies that glue these elements together.   Though I believe my music is more towards the deep/low side of dubstep I don't hear a lot of music that sounds like what I make.

Thank you for your consideration and regardless of the decisions made I will be tuning in to the festival and donating what I can to help out the Artists.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,widowmusic@hotmail.com,completed,2020-05-22 8:07,,2020-05-23 6:08,102ad79bc5,

Growing up in the Lower Mainland, we’ve always felt that despite the “No Fun City” label, Vancouver is home to a vibrant artistic community… but as artists, we face so many hurdles in trying to cultivate safe and inclusive community spaces. Both at home and internationally, corporations mistreat their audiences by failing to book diverse lineups, having inadequate approaches to harm reduction, or failing to have responsible environmental policies. 

Much like IMPACT, the PHASE SHIFT project was born out of a desire to do something more. Our vision is to foster the vibrant electronic music scene in BC and beyond while staying true to the heart and soul of electronic music culture by cultivating diversity, harm reduction, and environmental sustainability at all of our shows.

First, I grew up in a small town in northern British Columbia called Prince Rupert. My family is of mixed heritage: my mom is First Nations and my dad has European ancestry. Prince Rupert is not always the most progressive place, and I grew up rejecting my Indigenous ancestry, customs, and family. When I moved to Vancouver for university, I finally became connected to my culture, because I met strong Indigenous role models and advocates. This was at the same time that I started to listen to electronic music, which I instantly fell in love with. I've always been drawn to the darker sounds of EDM, and it was pretty easy to tell that all of the bass and dubstep producers back then were all male. However, things have changed now, more and more women are starting to break into the industry and represent Canada and BC! People like Rezz and Whipped Cream are international stars, while we also have local, rising talents like Sheevs throwing down at Red Room. I want to play at Impact Fest to highlight the inclusivity of EDM and that it welcomes all people, no matter your heritage, culture, or gender. 

Secondly, I have admired Impact Festival from its first year. Although the current health crisis has led to an uprising in the number of charity events, Impact Fest was a true pioneer. From its inception it wanted to be different. As such, I tried to incorporate that same ethos into the mix I submitted for this application. As of yet, I haven't been able to produce a track of my own, but I have been diligently using Ableton Live to create my own unique edits and mash ups. I believe that the recipe for an unforgettable DJ set is to incorporate a bit of the old, the comfortable, and the known but present it in a new way, with a new twist. I created this set for you to showcase my range and that I am comfortable at, and changing between, many different BPMs. Ultimately, DJ Beer is about the inclusivity of EDM, showcasing local talent, female DJs and producers, and reaffirming to the world that girls can throw down too.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,completed,2020-05-23 19:18,,2020-05-23 20:02,f8ae82ada1,

Evolving our human awareness to identify, understand, and transform our beliefs allows us to experience the  full potential of our essence.  

I am the co-founder of SEE Uniqueness, a Director of Women Talk,  International Speaker & Author, and I have a passion to facilitate conversations of celebration and connection through varying formats.   As an Intuitive Connection Strategist and Catalyst for Inclusion Consciousness, I  facilitate programs, conversations, and opportunities that build interactions with impact.   I work with leaders and messengers ensuring they are equipped to create powerful and caring connections for individuals, families, and communities.  

 Along with my daughter Sydney, who is an award winning young woman with Down Syndrome, we started the 'Sydney's Million' movement inviting 1 Million people to celebrate and share their Uniqueness.  We are creating a new language in which to be curious,  SEE Uniqueness and Celebrate each other.   Curiosity creates connection, connection builds community, and community enhances our world! 

Staying in the conversation of celebrating uniqueness is even more important during this time of global transformation.  Over the past few months more then 6000 viewers have been impacted in our series of over 40 SEE Uniqueness Celebrates You FB Live events and the launch of our Conscious Conversations show.  

I have witnessed the  impact of a soul recognizing and celebrating their uniqueness.  Wether it happens instantly or over time,  it always creates a ripple that changes families, and the world around us.    The Impact Festival is creating a ripple that will affect the conscious awareness of our world.

The greatest potential for us human beings lies in our ability to work together.

However, too often, our preconceived notions, hard-earned independence, and subconscious insecurities get in the way and impede our growth.

We are all a set of unconscious patterns. Patterned thoughts are like computer programs that our minds cycle through routinely, which then generate a set of patterned attitudes and behaviors.

We can uninstall the programs that are harmful and preventing us from creating better lives. We can also install new programs to override the faulty thinking and behavioral patterns so that together, we can create a more peaceful world.

Your most important relationship is the one you have with yourself - and there's a science to it called Attachment Styles.

What you unconsciously believe to be true about yourself is also based on science, and it drives all your behaviors. With the knowledge of Attachment Styles, you have the opportunity to transform yourself, your relationships, and your community.",50,,"Elijah Ignatieff and Shaq Dhanji (along with the whole Dhanji clan - Amrita, Zamir, and Raam Dhanji","Projector & screen, pens for attendees to take notes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,completed,2020-03-11 17:11,,2020-03-11 17:35,93d1d3aa89,

Animals have always live in harmony, but we humans have threatened our own habitat with greed and ego. Through the wisdom of the indigenous people and the animal kingdom, we might be able to restore how to live in harmony with the planet, and bring balance back into the world. In this day in age, it is crucial for the world to hear this message before our destruction has reached a disastrous threshold.

Kashi is a self-taught visionary artist from Victoria, British Columbia. Her active creativity sprung up at an early age, constantly fueling her passion through drawing, painting and sculpting to bring her visions to life.
As a child, she deeply felt her calling in amplifying the voices of the animal kingdom. Now, she walks along side and calls in the spirits of the animals to assist her in her paintings, allowing them to tell their story through her and embed their essence into the canvas to reach the hearts and soul of others. Her ultimate goal and devotion is to assist the evolution of consciousness, and activate beholders into higher states of awareness.

Kashi's paintings advocate the voices and stories told by the indigenous people all over the world, including the messages and wisdom of the animal medicine. By having them lead and guide us forward towards the paths of our ancestral roots and traditions, they teach us how to be in harmony within ourselves, and in Oneness with the planet. We can achieve this by caring for all inhabitants and remaining connected to our sacred and only planet we call home, Mother Earth.

Her artistic gift to the world is mysterious and influential, as she also embeds intention, prayer and awareness into every brushstroke to spark inspiration in others and assist the birthing of the new age of man. This modality is expressed to awaken the creative light within, and create a positive impact within the hearts of all.",,,https://facebook.com/kashi.visionary.art/,,We are local to the Lower Mainland in B.C.,We cater to the festival community,,30%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,completed,2020-07-15 23:38,,2020-07-15 23:45,216f7fa914,
