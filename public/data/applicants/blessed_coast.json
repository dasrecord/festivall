The energy of the music, the dancers is so driving and inspiring.\r\n\r\nI like to install my easel around the dance floor and invite people to paint. It is often their first contact with the playfulness of oil paints. For some it is a beautiful discovery. For others it is a deep exploration of themselves.   Sometimes, experimented painters come to put their touch! I smoothly direct the activity so the people can learn and have fun at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is an always renewed discovery of how the music, the brush, your body and soul come to dance with the paint.\r\n\r\nSince I've been running this setup for while now I've acquired a lot of ''painting in parties'' experience. The setup may run on the party’s electrical setup or can be run on batteries. It is sturdy and it is not messy. The whole setup is quite adaptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Sonic collaborators may present their own sonic footprint gathering devices. CEEM nomads (i.e., other  artists) may tether their gear to Cosmo’s to intercept and co-mingle sonic signals.

When they got the whole pub up on their feet later that night at the open mic, starting a band just felt right. The girls started playing the Vancouver circuit with original reggae, folk and country tunes. Known for infectious grooves, super-good vibes and great jams, G&M quickly grew to become a powerful mix of 7 talented ladies and 1 bad-ass dude rockin’ some of the sweetest, most intimate venues in Vancouver. Each Ginger & Moonshine member writes their own music, stretching the band’s range to encompass everything from dub and reggae to salsa, jazz, blues, rock/pop and folk. Rich 4-part harmonies, violin, trumpet and keys give G&M’s music a beautiful, unified sound that transcends genres and makes you feel good.",

        "bio": "I am a beatboxer (one of Canada's top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships), producer, and DJ. What I am offering is a one of a kind, unique performance merging live beatboxing with a high energy electronic set composed largely of my original productions! \r\n\r\nHere is my artist biography; \r\n\r\nIt's hard to believe the music blaring through the speakers is coming entirely from his mouth; with that rattling bass, layered in perfectly timed beats and dimensional sounds. The melody is there, you get lost in the beat, and just fall along with the drop. Beatboxing at it's finest. After all, you are only listening to British Columbia's top beatboxer, and one of Canada's top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships. It's the perfect intro for the set he's about to mix; a variety of tunes, including many of his own productions, sure to keep any crowd swimming hard through those sound waves all through the night. Chrizpy Chriz is a show you simply cannot miss; stage presence, personality and, of course, talent all up on one stage. He is well known through the interior of British Columbia having placed a lasting impression on the many crowds he's provided with the gift of his sound art. You might have caught him rocking his decks at underground shows and festivals, including, but not limited to, Burning Man (NV, USA), Elysium (the Blue), Felurian Grove, Kicking Up Dirt, IUG Jamboree, Get Bananas, U4eeyah, and a spontaneous in-between performance at Envision (Costa Rica), opening for artists such as Snak the Ripper, Mark Instinct, Terravita, Mat the Alien, Meikulator (Perkulat0r and Alex Mei), Ill-esha, and Pigeon Hole. Headlining Cascadia NW (WA, USA) as part of the Future Perfect Events showcase, he shared the main stage with artists such as  Penny Wide Pupils, Kozmo, Willdabeast, Bleep Bloop, and Tipper. He's also played shows in California and Washington, pulling in crowds , and performed right alongside the well known Micheal Winslow. His YouTube reputation is also not a disappointment, with an ever-growing following of over 1100 subscribers, over 300,000 views, and holding a partnership with Fullscreen inc. Chrizpy Chriz is a performance you won't regret bringing to your stage or event. Prepare yourself for a show you won't forget. \r\n\r\nAt events and festivals, Chrizpy Chriz offers beatboxing workshops. Suitable for all levels, learn the basics of beatboxing as well as more advanced techniques and sounds. You'll also get to appreciate a short performance and there is always plenty of space to get any questions you may have answered.\r\n\r\nArtist Statement;\r\n\r\n\"I have fully immersed myself in the crazy world that is electronic music and the scene that come with it. Absolutely passionate about what I do, I have taken on music full time and am pouring myself into the ultimate creation of sound. I strive to create a positive vibe and keep a crowd dancing to an ever changing combination of beats and sound waves. One of my goals as an artist is to help merge the line between the electronic and the organic creation of sound.�\r\n\r\nI would just like to add a huge thank you for taking the time to review my application and take me into consideration for Blessed Coast 2016, I would be stoked for the opportunity to participate in this lovely event! I look forward to hearing back!\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\nChris Gouchie",

The journey began with playing the guitar, drums, bass, DJembe and from classical rock and progressive rock to thrash metal. Eventually I realised that there is a global space in which people dance and express themselves with lesser bias. Its about collective catharsis and freedom. I was partly raised in Goa, India, which is the hub for a counterculture. I believe that at the end of the day, the underground is all one. Which is why I have two projects, one that spreads the psytrance meaning. The other takes inspiration from all other forms of underground dance music (acid house, techno, IDM)(as well as listening) and comes out in a more hybrid format. A blend one would say. I produce original music and also push artists that are intelligent, eclectic and groovy.",

Kyler Schogen hits a \r\nsweet spot musically, that area just where rock, blues and folk converge. It is a place which \r\nmusically, is almost ideal, at least to my ears, a devout blues lover, who appreciates a good rock \r\nsong, and the lyrical strength of folk. It's a crossover locale others have visited, some making it their musical home. Schogen should certainly make it his residence since he is clearly at home in this neighbourhood. The end result is a pleasing CD, an effort worth lending an ear to, just maybe regularly.\" \r\n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Jul 27, 2011) \r\n\r\n\"Kyler Schogen headlined the evening, (Springtime in Alberta Festival, Hayloft Acres). The band played an original set and captivated the crowd with thought provoking lyrics and hooky melodies from their new CD, \"Pocket Fulla Nothin'\". They rose above an evening chorus of mosquitoes and frogs to wow an appreciative audience. \"\r\n- Karen Pedlar, Smoky Lake Signal (May 25, 2011) \r\n\r\n\"(Review of \"Electric Life\" - Kyler Schogen, SunCave Records. Released March 1/ 2009.) Schogen is actually a veteran blues man, having recorded several CDs since the mid-1990s with his own band. The music is that sort of good-timing blues which gets the toes tapping. The music has the sad side of life lyrics, but the music suggests tossing the negativity and having some fun. Schogen does a good job of offering up that take on things. A fun blues CD disk for a summer drive.\"                \r\n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Sep 01, 2010) \r\n\r\n\"Starlight Dreams is a well-composed collection of songs that will certainly take the listener on a journey as it fuses a bluesy approach with Spanish and Latin sounding melodies.�\r\n- Alan Kausy, Smoky Lake Signal (Aug 26, 2015)\r\n",

I sing my own songs in French and English and also a wide repertoire of covers (100 songs) from my favorite artistes: Tracy Chapman, Ben Harper, Eva Cassidy, Boy, You + Me, Jeff Buckley, Georges Brassens, Camille, Saez, Edith Piaf.. to name a few.\r\nMy type of music (acoustic folk/pop/blues/rock) is pretty smooth and moody with a minimalist setting : my (said-to-be) aerial emotion-charged vocals and my guitar and/or ukulele mostly finger-picked melodies. I sing raw feelings from a place of deep sensitivity and vulnerability with the dream of touching and opening hearts (ambitious I know ;)).\r\n\r\nYou'll find my most recent recordings on Reverbnation and on my website: https://www.reverbnation.com/chtitefille\r\nhttp://chtitefille.wix.com/chtitefille\r\n\r\nI would love and would be grateful to be part of the musicians crew for this year's blessed coast festival.

It brings up insecurities, values, expectations, conditioning, suppressed emotions, memories etc. Many tools work similarly, but, as a musician, songwriting and music production are my preferred methods. My album is a manifestation of my inner process and the drop of inspiration that I hope will ripple from my inner being, out through my music, into my behaviour, through my interactions and out into my community. \r\n\r\nThe profound influence parents have on their children during their cognitive development has illuminated my understanding of how we influence everyone around us and how we are constantly shaped by our relationships and social interactions. As a privileged, educated, young woman I feel a personal responsibility to critically self-reflect and become conscious of the ways in which I interact with and influence others.\r\nI am not a mother, but I am an artist, and I know that art�in my case music�has tremendous power to emotionally touch, inspire and affect others. It is a community builder and a powerful language. I use this language to communicate my truth, attract like-minded individuals, deeply and intimately connect with myself and others, and thereby build community.\r\nI want to live in a healthy community with a healthy culture where individuals are free to be themselves, where people's experience and expression are validated and pursuing self-actualization feels safe and supported. I have set out to seed such a community through music: through creative collaboration and through personal as well as interpersonal shadow-work. By recording my music, which reflects my values and my vision, I am planting a seed for a collaborative community around me. I feel pregnant with a culture, and I am motherly committed to nurturing it and bringing it into this world.\r\n\r\nMy songs are inspired by my own experience and the core messages are often about truely looking at our values. I express my own values such as care for the environment, family, love and gratitude for all the mothers and lifegvers, and I sometimes make little social commentaries about the society we live in, yet all with a flowy, dancy feel. \r\n\r\nI play my live sets with a violinist, another gutar player and a beatboxer. The sound is simillar to the album but has a slightly folkyer vibe. \r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nBarbora Ravensdaughter\r\n",

Much comes up during sessions and journeys and I speak to the awareness of sound being an access point in physical, mental, emotional and energetic aspects of healing, selfawareness and I work with the power of intention, and the witness of these aspects. I enjoy some sharing time after most journeys, though sometimes a mandala creation or journaling is more appropriate. I begin by softly guide participants into their breath, as they lay on the ground, connecting deeply to the core of the earth. I  bring on the large frequencies of the bowls and then vowels and tones of voice. I use a beautiful, strong voice that brings people deep into their journey and holds just as strong of a loving, nurturing space for whatever comes up. \r\nAfter the journey, I play the lyre and pyramid over bodies, some energy work, soft touching if consented, and I bring people slowly back to the ground, their bodies and this physical space. I create a long moment for integration, sharing and journaling time. <3",

Three months after graduating high-school, the teen left home on a solo adventure to the other side of the world in pursuit of experiences and knowledge.\r\n\r\nLiving a secure and easy life under the wing of his parents was something Sam did not approve of. Perhaps it was the fact that he was born an only child, but his craving for independence led him to live a life against the grain of social norms. Instead of celebrating his 18th birthday with an extravagant party, he chose to run around signing forms and taking photos to finalise his passport. Or when faced with the task of paying rent, he went busking 6 hours a day, 7 days a week in subway stations instead of relying on an employer.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling from east to west in Canada, Sam has found his home in Vancouver. The city's focus on social and mental consciousness has been swallowed in large gulps and transformed into inspiration for him to write many songs, namely so, 'Just Breathe'. A catalogue of other songs are also at a ready to record state. \r\n\r\nDue to his motivated demeanor and eagerness to shake every hand, Sam has been presented with many opportunities and received plenty of support from the good friends he has made in the local Vancouver music scene. Experiencing this camaraderie has taught him that accepting help is okay, as long as you are working hard enough to deserve it.\r\n",

        "bio": "Meet Vancouver’s rising vocal talent, Sophia Danai, whose voice is as honest as her lyrics with a sound that ranges from alternative r&b to sultry electro-pop. Okayplayer dubbed her a mix of Billie Holiday and Portishead, adding that she’s a \"dynamic singer with an obvious foundation in soul”. After leaving her first record-contract with The Hastings set due to creative differences, Sophia went back to school to enhance her skills as a producer and sound engineer so she could have more control over her creative process and further explore her artistry.  With a new found sense of empowerment as an independent artist, Sophia has created a new record in which the raw beauty of her voice takes centre stage. \r\n\r\nHer debut album, Love Royale, set to be released in February 2016, is an evocative collection of songs intended to take the listener on an introspective journey.  Sophia has spent the last two years honing her production skills, and collaborating with a variety of artists and producers such as Grammy award winning, Jon Brown (Meghan Trainor, Pink) and Vancouver's own, Matt Brevner. Inspired by Brown's LA studio, built inside one of Marilyn Monroe's early homes, Sophia's newly released single and music video, Daytime Dreaming, has an essence of old hollywood glamour. With its compelling arrangement of music and lyrics, Daytime Dreaming tells a story of longing for something more.\r\n\r\nWith the release of her first EP, Wishing Well, 2013 was a breakthrough year for Sophia. Wishing Well was produced by grammy award winner Chin Injeti, and featured Talib Kwali, Shad and DJ Khalil. Her song, \"Higher Baby\", was licensed to Appleton Rum for a nation wide advertising campaign, and she garnered two Juno nominations for her work with Madchild, and rising stars SonReal and Rich Kidd. Sophia, a dynamic performer, has shared the stage with Aloe Blacc, Quadron, and De La Soul. Other notable performances include last year's Manifesto Festival in Dundas Square Toronto, and the 102nd Grey Cup Festival in Vancouver.\r\n\r\nSophia, always evolving in her artistry, is a talent to watch for. Look out for her touring across Canada and the U.S. in support of Love Royale.\t\r\n\"If you can imagine a perfect balance between the sass of the Spice Girls and the depth of Aretha Franklin, it would be Sophia Danai. Not only does the sound of her voice pierce past your soul like a spear, but she also has as much energy and positivity as the sun.\"  - ION MAGAZINE.",

While jamming on the beach, singer/guitarists Zach Cornfield and Damon Hanly lamented the fact that there was nowhere in their city to go to listen to the old-school reggae hits they so enjoyed playing. After pondering on this for a brief moment, the obvious solution to this simple problem became apparent: start a reggae band! A couple of weeks later, the curly-haired duo did just that, and recruited bassist Leo Bell and drummer Mike Ramos to complete the lineup. After a successful outdoor gig at The Libra Room during Car Free Days on Commercial Drive, the band went on to secure a monthly gig at the local East Van music hotspot. The band has since played the Make Music Festival in Vancouver, and has also brought their irie vibes to shows in Squamish and Whistler. Reggaelution also recently played to their largest crowd yet at the Vancouver Art Gallery for the Cannabis Day rally. Playing everything from Desmond Dekker to Barrington Levy, Bob Marley to Jacob Miller, Burning Spear to Gregory Isaacs, the band focuses on bringing that laid back roots reggae sound to their live shows, which inevitably end up with people dancing on their feet, or at the very least, grooving in their seats.

Sub Theory is much more than a collection of beats; it is a musical project that reflects the culmination of almost a decade’s worth touring and performing. Laying his hands on production and live performance, Sub Theory brings together a potent mix of Bass dub, and ethnic fusion in to his sets.\r\n\r\nTo his ever-expanding fanbase, Sub Theory is much more than a DJ or producer; he is a master crafter of the collective experience, a shaman of spiritual escape found by following the beats. The journey continues; turning 34 this year, Sub Theory has only scratched the surface of himself as an artist and a person. Resonating on a deeper level, this is Sub Theory’s spirit shining through the haze, breaking through the foggy veil of singularity to find the human connection.",

I can do all kinds of styles - the only thing that stays consistent between my sets is that I loop it all live (and it's improvised). I would love to play a trippy downtempo set, a funky housey set, a live rock set, a dnb set, etc. \r\n\r\nI would also love to collaborate with other musicians there. I'd love to be able to lay down a beat and a bass groove, and then just rock out with some other peeps all on our own various instruments. If you guys have a drumset there too, that would be phenomenal (I've been playing the drums for 10+ years) - though I'd need to practice here in Vancouver first in order to integrate it into my live show. \r\n\r\nAs far as requirements go, I don't really have any... Ideally you guys would be able to have an audio interface I could use for my set, since mine is super heavy and I don't have a vehicle... Transportation + a safe place to leave my gear actually might be a reuiqrement? Not sure - I'd have to figure out logistics. \r\n\r\nAn awesome thing to have would be a video feed from the stage so that people watching can see what I'm doing (they can connect the sounds they hear directly to what I do with my various machines!). \r\n\r\nAnyway this is getting pretty long, so I'll end this application now. In case it isn't clear from here, I have a lot of energy and would love to be part of the entertainment for One Love. Sounds like a wicked festival.",

I have to cater to bar fans at those gigs but I'm very very passionate about spinning music that inspires love, peace, creativity and unity. Music is an integral part of my life, it's literally all I do. If I'm not listening to music for other people to jam to I'm listening to music to get me inspired to create. I DJ acid jazz, psychedelic rock and psychedelic music in general, blues, folk, reggae, downtempo, electronica, hip hop, classic rock, neo psychedelia, ambient, and more. I don't limit my musical genres I just mix what sounds good and gets the crowd dancing and shouting with love. I also am a hip hop artist with lots of finished songs I could incorporate into my DJ set, my lyrics are about consciousness and life and energy, not the generic rapper lyrics you would think of when you hear Hip Hop. This is Hip Hop from the mind, body and soul. Music at it's purest. You can check out two of my tracks at www.soundcloud.com/originofspin . Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!

I work with vinyl, love & skill on two to three turntables, crafting deep journeys through layered sounds of underground rhythm. I'm inspired by cosmic and outerspace sounds that connect spirituality to science fiction... what is known as Afrofuturism... In dub the science fictional sound manifests through Lee Scratch Perry and Scientist... in dub techno, this comes together in 4/4 deep bass rhythms and shifting percussion in Basic Channel... I'm originally from Vancouver, where during the '90s I was director of the <ST> collective (http://shrumtribe.com). We collaborated with rave_era collectives HQ Communications, B-Side, and TeamLounge (whose members are still around today). Throughout the 2000s, I spent a decade in Montreal, playing festivals like MUTEK and Montreal Electronic Groove, as well as across North America, Europe, and elsewhere... Wherever I go, I keep to the underground, organising small events, collaborating with electronic and live musicians, and releasing on my experimental label IO SOUND [ http://iosound.ca ]. In 2008 I moved back out West to reorient myself to the forest and shifting glaciers. I bless nature everyday with movement and sound. Over the past few years I have played Believe Festival and Bass Coast as well as smaller Whistler gatherings organised by Miss Kosmik... \r\n\r\n:: bio ::\r\nhttp://DJtobias.com/bio/\r\n\r\n:: ION STORM radio on DeRadio.ca ::\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/DJtobias\r\n\r\n:: dub techno oriented set ::\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/DJtobias/ionstorm003\r\n\r\npeace.",

The project works to mobilize the music industry to speak up for the environmental realities of our time and empowers bands and artists to be part of the solution, in alignment with First Nations leadership and solidarity (take a look at thejellyfishproject.org).\r\n\r\n\r\nI also have an enormous love of hand-lettering, and have a tendency to leave a trail of beautiful and uplifting signs wherever I go. You can see a bit of my work at instagram.com/lovelettersforeverybody, or for a bit more of a detailed look at my work as an artist in service of community, at lovelettersforeverybody.ca. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I am lit up on learning and service, and feel there are no better spaces to learn more about who we really are and how we can create better ways to support & care for each other than when connecting with music & art, the land, and each other. I offer my music to my incredible community wherever possible, from fundraisers to conferences, and I try to remember to walk through the world joyfully and as a student in the hopes that makes me teachable in every space I enter.\r\n",

Finding a beautiful place to live in Squamish, B.C Will quickly caught the eyes and ears of the Sea to Sky area and won both The Whistler Talent Search 2014 and the Squamish Reader's Choice top musician of 2014. Joining forces with some of the highest caliber musicians Squamish had to offer, he formed the Will Ross Band. They recorded their first full length record, Freeloader, which was released August 2014 and has been getting great reviews. A mix of many different genres, Will likes to refer to the sound as “acoustic funkified folk rock and roll.”\r\n\r\nLinks to sounds: \r\n\r\nhttp://willross.bandcamp.com/track/freeloader\r\n\r\nhttp://willross.bandcamp.com/track/not-the-predicate\r\n\r\nWe typically charge $600-$800 for shows however price is always negotiable :).",

His dimension-shattering innovational sounds are unparalleled from dolphins, whales, birds and ufo’s, to all-encompassing “walls of sound”. From trance like, water dripping, rainbow portal inspired songs of ascension, to thunderous cell penetrating sonic sound healing to the most delicate harmonics or lightning fast licks, he is the full package. Grammy nominee and Independent music winner, who has been featured on MTV’s Real World, Fusion TV in Mexico, National Public Radio, Wisdom Radio, Burning Man Festival and have been on major world tours as opening act from Sarah McLaclan, Joe Satriani, Chicago, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne and many others. Using crystals, stones, lasers, violin bow, meteorites, ankle bells and more, this explosive and eternally spontaneous musician puts on a stellar show that one never forgets and the inspiration that the crowd feeds on is overflowing. Playing the guitar with a love filled joy tuned to an ancient frequency, leaves one’s senses coated in fractals, harmonics, and DNA-upgrading sounds of color, cradled in the arms of rebirth, transformation and bliss. He is a very passionate, dynamically rhythmic, instrumental, one man band performer, developing complex and very energetic world tribal progressions on his alternately tuned guitar. His creative guitar sound can easily fill huge venues. He is truly a show stopper that leave audiences wanting more.

It would be an honor to share in this community. I would be most likely flying in coming from Mt Shasta, California area if you are open to having me perform as one of the main stage acts. I look forward to your response shortly.\r\nAlways in gratitude,\r\nScott Huckabay\r\nGuitar Alchemyst",

He has a unique propensity for meshing smooth rhythms and legendary guitar chops with driving and hypnotic melodies around deeply relevant subject matter. Drew has six albums and plays songs of many genres, styles, and volumes (from supper-club quiet to Rock n' Roll clubs and festivals) but his music is most often classified as Conscious Soul Music. Drew performs solo acoustic, with a full rhythm section or as a duo with a bass player/backup singer, his loop pedal and guitar, layering guitar parts, three-part harmonies, bass and drum beats for a full, smooth and danceable sound. Drew Rouse and his band are able to play three one-hour sets of live, original music which is easily suited to a variety of different venues.\r\n \r\ndrewrouse.com\r\n\r\n\"The consciousness is rising because some of us are lifting it\" ~D.R.",

Most of our songs are sung in Romani or Serbian/Macedonian. We are now in our seventh year, and have a solid lineup of excellent musicians who have learned this music style directly from Roma trumpet master Demiran Cerimovic, whom we bring annually from Serbia. We have honed a repertoire of over 50 tunes, ranging from traditional wedding tunes to more modern jazz-influenced pieces and party songs.",

Known for our undeniably contagious, high energy sets, teamwork on the decks, and deep wobbly rolling basslines; we have gained a large following and an expectation to always deliver a top notch performance. With over 70 shows and 8 music festivals in the past year alone, we are starting to capture the attention of a global audience. We've have played several shows in the Southern California region and toured in the US, Spain and Mexico.\r\n\r\nNot only do we spend countless hours refining our mixing skills, but we also produce our own tracks. With an ear for the music, the transition into production was natural. We have already released 6 original tracks and 2 remixes in our first year of producing, 3 of which were signed to record labels (MalLabel Music, Helitricity Records, Sheppard Records).  Our first Beatport release in January 2017, 'Hot Boi' charted in the Top 100 Indie Dance/Nu Disco Releases, reaching spot #4. We are currently producing our first album :) \r\n\r\nOur music can be described as bouncy, 4 to the floor beats, characterized by pretty melodies and deep, wobbly, rolling basslines; heavily influenced by hip hop and the underground bass house music scene. The love and passion we have for our craft and for each other is undeniable and transcends everything we do! Specializing in Wobble House, G House, Tech House, and Brazilian Bass.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I have a varied and eclectic taste in music colored by my experiences and the cities I've lived in over the years - Toronto, Melbourne, Berlin, and now Victoria (my current home).  I like to share with the listener or dancer something they might not have heard before, or put something in a new context.   I like to play multi-genre sets that take people on a journey.  Deep, hypnotic, warm and soulful are vibes I like to share.  I prefer daytime/evening/warm-up time-slots.\r\n\r\nMy sounds usually involve dub/reggae/world/jazz often crossed with house, techno, bass, and ambient/chill.

[from my Mixcloud bio]\r\n\r\nEver since attending and volunteering at Blessed Coast last year I've wanted to play a set there.

(If I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember the music only starting in the afternoon at some point..?).   Anyway, I'll leave that up to you ;-)  The mix is called Innaspace (ie.

My DJ/live sets are geared towards a dance floor experience! I mix my original productions with like minded bass music from west coast, infused with a underground uk influence. My sets have often been described as a sonic journey, floating from genre to genre while still intertwining a cohesive low end feel and good vibrations. My good friend Pacha Papa played last year and suggested I look into the festival it being in line with my feels and values. As I'm currently booking my summer for 2017 I'd love to make Blessed Coast a part of it!",

With the massive success of the night, the two creators Joni T & La Dooda decided they had something special going on and join forces. The two absorbed the name Case of the Mondays and hit the Studio. Releasing Two records with Unknown Records (Sydney), an official remix with Rod Fussy (Billions) , and a dance floor filling remix of Bad & Boujee, it's safe to say the boys have had a busy year.\r\n\r\nCOTM would describe there sound as \"Deep in Tone and Ghetto by Nature.\" Over the past two years they have played several Canadian Music Festivals, Pool Parties across Central America, Countless Clubs, Private events, and have opened up for many of their musical heroes and the best in the industry.

Representing Vancouver's famed SHAHDJs crew, they have been honing their skills for years. Producing their own unique brand of infectious bass music, they represent an exciting wave of talent from Canada's West Coast. Effortlessly combining elements of Drum & Bass, Hip Hop, Jungle and Footwork, their music is a perfect representation of all that is right with underground dance music.The iconic melodies and depth in their work is evident in their sound, which ranges from tough badboy swagger to smooth dubby grooves. Their first release came in 2016 with the \"Samhain EP\" on Black Tuna Recordings, followed by their \"Diamonds EP\" on Aufect Recordings that received support from Ivy Lab, Dexta, and Doctor Jeep to name a few.

Noetik was quickly drawn to beat making for lyricists and underground events. While dedicating his life to Hip Hop culture Noetik became strongly influenced by breakbeat, world music and future bass. In the process of creating new genres of music, anchored by the back bone of Hip Hop, Noetik relocated to the California Bay Area in 2010. After being submerged into West Coast Bass Music, Noetik began making music to compliment his recordings of tablas, wood winds, berimbaus and various world instruments.

Her collage of lyrical rap flow and smooth vocal melodies over criss-crossing genres has earned her a loyal tribe and expanding fan base. Lozen exudes an energy that is both raw and authentic. Live shows have evolved her unique approach to Hip Hop while recordings have pushed her sound across the globe.\r\n\r\nLozen's success sparked when she teamed up with Bombastic Jam Label boss and funk producer Basement Freaks (Hamburg, Germany). Bootyfunk (2011) garnered a significant amount of online press, reaching No#3 on junodownload.com and racked up hundreds of thousands of plays on\r\nsoundcloud.com with the overwhelming public response received from the \"Records in the Crate\" single remix competition. Lozen was able to keep the momentum going with Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON) releasing Tragedy & Triumph Mixtape (2012) which ranked No#10 on the National Hip Hop Charts.\r\n\r\nAfter opening for roster of heavyweights including De La Soul, Blackalicious, The Beatnuts, Masta Ace and Swollen Members it was time to hit the road. Touring with Kyprios and Animal Nation fueled the fire and the next collaborative project was born. Shake It Up (2014) was produced by Animal Nation and released via Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON), reaching No#6 on the National Hip Hop Charts and No#37 on CMJ USA Top 40 Hip Hop.\r\n\r\nWith a number of successful releases under her belt, headhunters have begun noticing Lozen’s refreshingly dynamic style. After spending several years refining her craft, this self-professed lyrical warrior has undoubtedly matured into an innovative new-school leader. Performing at world-renowned festivals; Envision 2015 (Uvita, Costa Rica), Shambhala Music Festival 2013 & 2010 (Nelson, BC) Lozen is quickly becoming a household name. Now achieving notable emcee status, add DJ and guitarist to the mix. Lozen's on the fly off the cuff spirit shines through when performing on stage. She has a way of connecting with her audience by bringing people together. The credo: Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons you can’t take your eyes off her is your ears. Soulful, yet gritty. Lighthearted, yet deep. Her work ethic and passion has earned her residency at nightclubs and radio shows, reaffirming why she remains a buzzworthy artist who grabs your attention. She’s positive proof that the industry doesn’t need to be resurrected; it just needs a woman’s touch every now and then.",

Surrounded by the same sounds as the rest of his generation, he managed to let the trends blaze by while piecing together a dark and cozy nest of warm vibes, and deep sounds. His style is a blend of bass music, mainly drawing influence from Dub, Jungle, and Hip Hop. In the past year he released his first two EPs on both Aufect and Dipped Recordings. Having played at the illustrious Bass Coast Festival, and alongside a tasteful group of international and acclaimed artists, Kurse seems to be properly dialed in. He is part of the Turu Crew, a collective of young, and like-minded producers/DJs, who have been pushing their sounds and curating events in Vancouver over the past 2 years.

Amble Greene is led by Cameron Gray and is considered a pseudonym for his solo project.\n\nThere's a certain spin of english about the name, which only adds to truth, most of his music is inspired by British 60's, and 70's pop/rock/folk acts.\n\nAmble Greene was selected in Vancouver's Peak Performance Project top 20 in 2013. Cam is currently living in his van which he has converted into a make-shift recording studio, and has been actively supporting the decentralization movement in Vancouver.\n\nHe jokingly refers to himself as \"solarpunk� for having futuristic gadgets, solar panels, wires and knobs housed in the shell of his 1981 V8 chevy funcraft. Believing music should transcend meaning into other mediums of communication, he is inspired by philosophy, technology, community, and sustainability, believing they're all integrated in one system.\n\nAmble Greene tries to tweak the traditional model of what's expected of an act. Sure there's showmanship, entertainment, but there's also innovation, forward thinking and most importantly an intimate connection.\n\nCam has also begun construction on a tiny house that he's building on a trailer. One day he hopes to live in this house and be able to record his own music at will. Ideally he would like to live sustainably, grow his own food and continue to explore this infinite world and its endless mysteries. \n\nHis end goal as an artist would be to inspire people to live differently and to become more conscious of the socio-economic problems that face our uncertain future.",

        "bio": "I am performing live painting, not on canvas, but rather on a person, a Devin nude body, and using henna as my medium - natural body art (temporary tattoos). \r\n\r\nThis live painting installation would start at sunrise near a music stage and end at sunset (to mimic the time of fasting for Muslims during the sacred month of Ramadan). I would cover the Devin body with traditional Arabic henna motifs prominent in Muslim culture and used for religious holidays and sacred unions such as weddings. And when the henna has dried and crumbled off, the skin will be stained with the motifs and will remain stained for several days.   \r\n\r\nThe concept of this live body painting installation is to intentionally juxtapose the two worlds that I come from - My Moroccan heritage, an Arabic culture which relies heavily on its conservative religious customs, and my French Canadian heritage - a very liberal, open-minded and free spirited realm. My questions in this installation are - What is sacred? What is forbidden? And why? What is the meaning of sacred? Where are the limits of beauty, divinity and blasphemy? And so I draw from these questions as I make my own lines from my heritage on a Devin nude body for all to see. \r\n\r\nI see divinity as a presence that is always there, and is either blocked and hidden or shining and flowing on to share and touch others. In this installation, the concept of staining skin for several days gives life and longevity to the art, as it will remain a shine and persist when I, the artist, has stopped \"painting�. Its is a moving installation, living, breathing, dancing, and ever changing, as the tint will fade after several days, and as the Devin body tans, sweats or freckles from the sun. \r\n\r\nThis is an original instillation, so I don't have a website showcasing my work, but I have attached my Pinterest page where I draw my inspiration of henna designs.

It will already be at Astral Harvest and Revelation this year, and still confirming details with Zion Noiz and What The Festival but it should be making rounds there too!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.luna-artanddesign.com/spirit-guides.html\r\n\r\n\r\nArt Exposition;\r\nI would love to bring in my 2D work to expose, some of it is blacklight reactive, and I have prints, leggings and scarves that I would like to vend on which I would be open to working out a commission rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoop Performances;\r\nI can perform during DJ sets, I have an LED smart hoop for night-time performances. I have previously performed at Shambhala, Cascadia NW, and Elysium, and have Astral Harvest confirmed for this year as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso open to potentially teaching hula hoop workshops!\r\n\r\nArtist Biography;\r\nLuna was barely five when her parents conveyed the concept of a \"job\" to her, and right then and there the answer already was \"an artist!\" Not many can say they've fulfilled their childhood dreams. In high school, she took art IB, did a two year pre-university program in visual arts and completed up to her second year at Emily Carr University before realizing that school wasn't for her. It was at this point in time that she set off on a journey with no other purpose than to experience, and it was then that she met her greatest of teachers, Mother Earth herself. Constantly inspired by the frantic, changing world by which she surrounds herself, Luna is always striving to create in new ways, new mediums, to share ideas and expand thoughts. To make you analyze the very fabric of life from another perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking my creations into consideration for exposition at Blessed Coast! I would just like to add that my boyfriend has also applied to perform as a musician (Chrizpy Chriz/Chris Gouchie) which means that I would not require any travel coverage if he were to make it in as well (and, since I know you are small budget, I would actually be completely open to doing it only for sale profits on my artwork, since if he is in, I would be there either way!). I look forward to hearing back!\r\n\r\nMuch Love,\r\nLuna ",

This album has been a few years in the making and will evolve the listener to a new state of mind. \r\nThe Dream Catcher features one of Hip Hop’s most celebrated lyricists and pillar for verbalists, the legendary Canibus. \r\nThis collaborative album features other great artists such as Planet Asia from Los Angeles and Moka Only from Vancouver. The production for The Dream Catcher was provided by Religion, Mob Robb, A.C.O., D. Clarke, Moka Only and Dangerous. \r\nAn excellent feature on the album is his brother’s group, Rhymists who consist of Jo Blunt and Spit Lyrics.

        "bio": "\"Steven Sedalia is a singer-songwriter forging a sunkissed folk fusion sound with carefully constructed stories and symbolism seemingly carved by the river itself, using organic acoustic instruments, along with earth-tone percussion and a bright mantric vocal style, his conscious messages emphasize themes of Love, wonder, and connection to the Great Mother Earth. Being raised in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, and living in his current home base on the isle of Kaua’i, in the Hawaiian island chain, the beauty of nature is ever present in the songs, providing a template for stories of adventure, growing pains, and deep reverence for the Land. In the music is the story of all lives, an honest grounding and a ruthless determination to transcend. Sedalia infuses with his live performance, a firm and compassionate call for environmental justice action and support, and creates a dynamic, interactive conversation through crowd involvement in the performance. Playing alongside artists such as Nahko & Medicine for the People, Xavier Rudd, and Tubby Love, Sedalia's music helps to push along the greater conscious music movement. Layered with ancient symbolism created by close contact with the flesh of the earth, along with the cultivation of the traveler’s wide eyes, the songs share the gift of unflinching compassion.\"\r\n\r\n\"In addition to being touring musicians, Sedalia and friends are organic farmers in Hawaii. Infused in the music is their love for the land and a call for a healthy relationship with the land through directly inspiring listeners into a feeling of reverence for nature.

I will make a welcome sign at the entrance to help people get to know this 4,000 year old practice that is found around the world in many different rituals and religions. The labyrinth will be set up and open all weekend (lines created with fabric layed out, maybe small stones, contained candles at night etc.) which I am willing to steward, monitor and maintain. I am also called to offer one/two time slots where the bowls will be set up and people can sit with me (in small group or one-on-one) before they walk to explore the different ways to Find deep purpose or intention in this dynamic meditation. This will be by signup or walk in (which ever suites the space/time best). When people are ready to enter the labyrinth with their new found intention and way of walking, I will play the Crystal Choir (crystal bowls, lyre, chimes etc) to allow for deep openings through the SoundSeed Medicine as they walk to centre and back out again. \r\nEither an installation for the entire weekend if we find an appropriate space, or at the main stage at sunset one night and i will create it for the use of 1.5/2hrs with candles, fabrics and offer a short description and play and invite people to walk for the duration of that time then take it down again. \r\n\r\nDescription: This mystical ritual, thousands of years old, is a metaphor or one's journey to the centre of understanding. The Labyrith is a sacred space, like the medicine wheel, and a universal symbol of peace. It is a pattern with purpose, an ancient tool that speaks to a long forgotten part of us. Lying dormant for centuries, labyrinths are undergoing a revival for use and interest. They offer a chance to take 'time out' from our busy lives, to leave schedules and stress behind. Walking its path is a gift we give to ourselves, leading to discovery, insight, peacefulness, happiness and sometimes tears, connectedness, and well being. \r\nThe Labyrith will be set up and open to walk any time all weekend, with ceremonial opening (friday time) and official closing (Sunday evening time). Please join for these specific times as well. There will be opportunity on (Saturday/sunday morning or afternoon -suggested 10am-1pm or 1pm-4pm) to explore 'The Labyrinth Walk: Finding the Sounds of Self.' In this dynamic meditation, Ocian with SoundSeed Medicine Journeys will help participants find intention and way of walking and then play crystal bowls and other instruments while you walk creating a beautiful unique soundscape as you walk the path to centre and back into the world again.

The Dome is too small with not enough air circulation to be holding deep sacred space. As well, I was given a 7pm space and the music was over bearing for a sound journey to take place at the same time. \r\nThe candles will be amazing in the grass there and if possible, I'd love to be set up to the sound system at the stage... \r\n$150 is mostly for installation costs: candles, holders, fabric, signs, string fence. \r\nIf you have another location suggestion that would suite this offering, please connect.\r\n",

One of the world's first international touring female loop artists, Mihirangi of Ngāti Rākeiora, Ngāti Waikorara, Ngāti Rāhiri and Ngāti Raukawa is a musical master in the art of songwriting & live-looping.\r\n\r\nMama Mihi is a songstress who has a tool-box full of musical magic; weaving live loops of vocals, intricate harmonies, tāonga puoro (traditional instruments), guitar, keyboards, world percussion with beat-boxing, drums and earth shaking bass lines with lyrics that melodically and poetically speak to indigenous and environmental issues. Supported by the dance, vocals and performance of her Māreikura the show is a colourful event of traditional and contemporary Māori culture celebrating the power and talent of our Māori women.\r\n\r\nAn artist-activist and a born entertainer, Mihirangi’s naturalness, infectious laughter and her authenticity means she doesn’t take herself too seriously. The refreshing aspect of her performance is the love and joy she has of live-improvisation and spontaneous crowd participation, her fearlessness and inclusivity draws her audience into the heart of her performances and into to the spirit of the magic she creates.\r\n\r\nThe Māreikura, recognized as female supernatural beings with noble whakapapa, genealogy, are Rita Peihopa of Ngāpuhi & Tiana King of Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairoa, Ngāti Whatua and Te Rarawa. Both who have been fully immersed in the Maori language and cultural revitalisation movement, and have an exceptional love of all things Māori to include both traditional & contemporary song & dance. Our Māreikura are both competitive kapahaka traditional performers and teachers of their language, culture and haka. Rita is a highly talented in traditional poi and mau-rākau, Māori weapons & martial arts. Tiana is a stunning and passionate contemporary Māori dancer, with a background in haka theatre and contemporary dance. Together the girls have performed on many festival stages and have professionally competed regionally and nationally for Te Taha Tu, a traditional Maori Performing Arts group.\r\n\r\nThis is the first year that Mihirangi’s new show “Mama Mihi & the Māreikura” are touring internationally and already the year is nearly booked out for the Commonwealth Games, Europe, Canada and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n“We’re taking this new show on the globe circuit to inspire the positive changes that we must make as a human family and we do this through sharing our traditions in a contemporary way that celebrates indigenous values that honour our relationship with Papatuanuku - Mother Earth” Mama Mihirangi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“She's just brilliant... in the 30 years I've toured the world I've never seen anything like her\" Ali Campbell UB40\r\n\r\n\"...infectious joy oozes from her very being, and captured our hearts... one of the most exciting, original and conscious solo performers of Australasia... an honour to watch” The Agency Victoria Australia\r\n\r\n“Her commanding presence will have you spellbound” NZ Herald\r\n\r\n‘The world is full of musical prodigies, but Mihirangi’s got them all beat: Between her appetite for musical adventure, her Māori roots, and her political convictions, she's the perfect model of a 21st-century shaman and star” The Georgia Straight - Vancouver\r\n\r\n\"One of the best things I've ever seen hands down... just mind blowing... there's some kind of transformative shifting thing going.” Jason Kerrison OpShop\r\n\r\n\"Unbelievable... from the beginning to the end, a super star... just mesmerizing.” Rachel Hunter",

Our community is hoping we play there and we are too! I have gone to Blessed Coast for the past 2 years and it would be an honor to be able to share our Ecstatic Meditative Kirtan with the Blessed Coast community. Last year, I was supporting the side Kirtan that Sacred hosted which was magical!! Would be open to others joining or collaborating for this offering!! Our band includes Ari Shiminoff on violin and vocals, Christian Douglas on mrdunga and Majo Sandy on cartels. I lead songs on both the harmonium and ukelele. My website is under construction at the moment but you can check out a few videos on my YouTube channel.  ",

My wife (singer/rapper) and I now share a beautiful 17 month old daughter, Naevia, and we have been trying to find something just like this to include her in. We would love to be a part of your growing gathering and see what its all about! Below is my career in a nutshell. \r\n\r\nOfficial bio:\r\n\r\n2-time Vancouver Island Music Award winner and WCMA nominee ‘Immaculate’ has pursued his life passion - writing, recording, producing and performing profanity-free hip-hop – for close to 15 years. Although his tastes and styles have evolved, his dedication to creating high quality, meaningful tracks that speak directly to his audience, has never wavered.\r\n\r\nConsistent, creative effort and collaboration has paid off. Immaculate has earned his reputation as a strong live performer having toured across 8 countries with established names including Machine Gun Kelly (MGK), Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Apathy and Celph Titled (the Demigodz) and Zion I and rocking festivals like Center of Gravity, Keloha, Hidden Music Festival, the Groove, YAA fest and the Golden Sound Festival and warming up audiences for numerous established names such as A$AP Rocky, Three 6 Mafia, Xzibit, M.O.P, Masta Ace, Wu-Tang, Souls of Mischief, Bliss n Eso, Warren G, Swollen Members, Shad, Illy, Zion I, Classified, Madchild, Sweatshop Union, DL Incognito, Moka Only, Emotionz, Kyprios, Sonreal, Snak the Ripper, Evil Ebenezer and many more.\r\n\r\nThe critically acclaimed rapper has also developed a solid buzz with the sales of thousands of copies of his 6 solo albums, his music charting on college radio, and winning several songwriting competitions. Immaculate has 6 official music videos one of which earned him a BCIMA nomination for 'Video of the Year'. Other critical recognition came when he was named ‘winner’ for his track ‘Destructive Behavior’ (reaching over 25,000 plays in it's first week) in an International song contest hosted by Life and Death Productions of Finland where he competed against hundreds of entries from around the world. Immaculate won first place in another world-wide collaboration contest for “Who’s the Illest” hosted by Arizona's Cryptic Wisdom and also made it to the finals of both the 2014 and 2015 Unsigned Only competition with over 10,000 submissions from over 100 countries.\r\n\r\nHis sixth independent release ‘Solitude’ highlights a new depth and maturity in his writing and production and features powerful tracks drawing from a recent family tragedy exemplifying the growth of an artist reinventing himself with every song.\r\n\r\nImmaculate has emerged as a significant voice in hip-hop – a voice well worth listening to.\r\n",

Time Nomads is a natural extension of my previous work, Global Nomads, a photo series dedicated to leaving countries better than found. It intends to explore two prominent issues in Canada:cultural identity and mental health. \r\n\r\nThe concept is for festival attendees to:\r\n1. Pick up a blank postcard from the “Open Here” side of the mailbox\r\n2. Capture their elevated and euphoric thoughts and immortalize it in the postcard\r\n3. Include their own mailing addresses\r\n4. Put it in the “Drop Off” slit of the mailbox (locked to secure privacy)\r\n\r\nI will then send out the uplifting messages back to them 6-8 months later when Seasonal Affective Disorder and other mental illnesses are heightened. Once more, by the time the postcards are mailed back to the attendees, it will be a great reminder to purchase their passes for Blessed Coast Festival 2019! ;) \r\n \r\nWhile the message will serve as an uplifting reminder of sun-kissed joy in the dead of winter, it also holds a deeper meaning. Every year, 1 in 5 Canadians experience a mental health or addiction problem, and 10-15% experience mild to clinical forms of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Mental disorders and substance abuse often go hand in hand, and can affect our thought processes, causing us to focus on our current misery and forget the times we felt great or even normal. Time Nomads is a harm reduction tool that attempts to link our good past experiences to our future mental health.\r\n\r\n",

I sat with 30 different subjects of various mixed cultural backgrounds, and painted the flags of their countries, or origin, on their faces. \r\n\r\nThe Installation\r\n The Time Nomads mailbox will be placed in a visible and convenient location on festival grounds. The “Open Me” side will be unlocked with blank postcards and several markers for festival goers to use, while the “Drop Off” side will be locked with a slit to allow completed postcards to be deposited. Some completed postcards are anonymously shared on the Instagram page: @Time_Nomads. As you can see from the attached draft images, the mailbox is illuminated by LED lights and has a secure, and eye-catching design. It is portable and extremely easy to set up and take down. ",

The entrancing steady beat of the drum is something that has taken me to beautiful places within myself over and over again and my production process emulates this. I always remind myself that if I don't \"get high\" from the music I am making, how could I ever expect anyone else to.

Bhagavan Shanmukha's book, the Divine Initiation is an esoteric de-coding of the vedas, and this collection of paintings is a visual interpretation of that de-coding. A spiritually based work of art to inspire the highest forms of self realization as the Limitless Boundless Infinite One.\r\n\r\n",

        "bio": "Sarah Wheeler\r\nBiography\r\n\r\n\"One of Vancouver's punchiest indie singers.\"  Fish Griwkowsky, Edmonton Sun\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler is queer artist and recent cancer survivor who is defined by power house vocals and an indomitable positive spirit.  A blazing live performer.  Although she has enjoyed collaborating with other musicians, lending her vocals to recordings such as “A Small Wonder” by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and sharing the stage with artists including Dan Mangan and Tanya Tagaq, this Vancouver-based artist has consistently remained focused on writing and performing her own music.  \r\n\r\nStuart Derdeyn from The Province reviewed Wheeler’s work by saying, “this is a very solid effort from an artist who has always had it but really tapped the right points and doesn't miss here”.\r\n\r\nLife changing experiences inspired Wheeler’s upcoming unreleased album Revival.  Having been diagnosed with cancer and undergone treatment that kept her from performing for a year, Sarah wrote much of what would become her newest album during that time.  Wheeler wrote, performed, produced and recorded all of the songs for Revival, giving it a perspective that is uniquely homemade.  The result is a collection of songs with an unforced honesty and message of positivity through dark times. \r\n\r\nWheeler’s musical heritage was handed down to her through her grandfather’s pioneering efforts as a jazz pianist in local Vancouver clubs during the 50’s and 60’s.  In that period he backed jazz greats including Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr.  Sarah's mother had music in her blood.  She started teaching Sarah to sing before she could walk, and raised her in a household amidst the sounds of classic rock n roll, blues, jazz, and country music. Growing into a seasoned recording artist has been a natural progression for Sarah.  In the present day pop culture climate of false celebrity, Sarah is an old fashioned believer in remembering that the true power of music is the love of it.  \r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler is a third generation Vancouver born Canadian singer/songwriter who has leant her vocals to recordings such as “Don’t You Think We Should Be Closer” by Edmonton's Mark Davis of Old Reliable, and played live with artists including Mike McDonald of Jr. Gone Wild and The Be Good Tanyas.  None of which means anything without something to say.  Wheeler’s new album is a true Revival.\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler has an \"effortlessly big voice which falls somewhere between Chrissie Hynde and Neko Case.\"-Adrian Mack The Georgia Straight\r\n",

        "bio": "Rae Vena presents : \"Inspire Love\" Live art tour 2017 \r\nAn Intimate exhibit of surreal  and live art!\r\n \r\nMy greatest success over the years has been sharing the gift of inspiration with others. Recent revelations have aided me to highlight this important intention for my 2017 festival tour. If I could carry only one message through my art it would be this simple but powerful verse:  “Inspire Love”  To your Neighbor, your friend, your son your daughter , the stranger you shared a smile with!  We all seek and aspire towards a positive epiphany at this particular cross road.     Through live art, self expression is a well loved journey both inwards and outwards!  Ineffable benefits are abound for the artist and beholder! What improv painting unfolds on my canvas further reflects another facet of my inner self.. Perhaps even a cue to the next path on my vision quest.   My past esteemed artworks have held upmost detail to a ethereal theme, and through this artistic style I envision my further transcendence in art.  Baby blue, pink and mint, a splash of black white, rainbow.. 8 years experience, and with each year passing my talent progresses; the best is only yet to come! I am more than excited to offer for 2017 “Inspire Love”  Live art by Rae Vena  \r\n Otherworldly, at first glance, a jumbo flower hangs down, art nestled between its petals.. A round canopy hangs from above, each pastel petal flows gently in the wind revealing its inner artful purpose. Inside, a nest of rugs & pillows surround an intimate exhibit of surreal art . In the center a blossoming live art painting takes host ! My art environment is part installation, part performance -for this is where my live art magic will take home for the weekend. By nightfall the glimmer of lights further invite observers to explore the art locus. Eclipsed by day, luminescent night sky will glow with curiosity on the inside floret. A live art hub,  where you can meet the artist, see the process and of course share space with others in creative conversation. This project is designed & will be handmade using as many up-cycled materials as possible. The top of the canopy is pvc tubing attached to roped pulley system. Pastel fabrics will be cut & sewn into the petals, then fitted with a bottom casing for water resistance. This canopy is decorative as well as useful for protection against rain, or simply roping off the art & displaying a \"closed\" sign during off hours for dancing! The essential benefit of hosting a space throughout the weekend is that guests can periodically visit to see an ongoing live art exhibit. Plans include fabricating a lock box for paints & tools of my trade & create a secure free standing wall from repurposed materials. If my timeline and costs doesn't permit the build of these extra elements, a heavy based easel will be secured  & a patio umbrella used as a base for my live painting. My installation is best suited under a tree to easily hang the canopy from above, if necessary a free standing method can be implemented with the patio base. I suggest distance of 30 meters or less to available electricity, and placement within earshot of a stage for musical inspiration! Thank you for joining me in celebrating my dedication in creation, for this unique festival exhibit  ~ Inspire Love , Blessed Coast 2017! ",

I have a vocal mic I can bring, otherwise, I will need a 3rd mic provided for my voice. I enjoy the effect of reverb added to the sound. ;)\r\n\r\nMy sound journey would best be experienced to either open or close an evening. To open, I would start with a meditation to bring everyone into a high vibe resonant state, primed to receive the musical expressions shared thereafter. \r\nTo close the evening, I would intend to bring everyone into a grounded state, connected with each other and their temple bodies, to seal the energy received prior, and to send everyone off into a blissful state for the rest of their night.  \r\n<3\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your consideration in providing a space for me to offer my sound at Blessed Coast Festival. I participated last year in the Healing Hut, sharing private sound sessions by donation, alongside a group of other wonderful healers. I feel strongly that my sound expression will be better received this year in a group setting, where our community will gather and collectively raise our vibration in the weave of the sound tapestry that I will create.\r\nI am soooo excited to participate and share my unique expression with this magical community that comes together for Blessed Coast. \r\n\r\nThank you for all that you do to create such a beautiful high vibe festival. <3 xo\r\n",

        "bio": "My name is Philip Auer and I am a passionate and ambitious up-and-coming musician who is interested in playing at your festival for 2017! I'll start off by telling you a little bit about my musical journey. \r\n\r\nI started playing classical piano from a young age and eventually fell in love with the instrument. I was then pulled into improvisation and jazz, and soon enough I began composing electronic bass music. I am now dedicating all my energy towards a music career and have just begun a jazz piano degree at Grant Macewan University. My vision is to combine the powerful sounds of electronic music with live piano into a combination which elates the dance-floor and inspires humanity.\r\n\r\nOver the last year, I have made many moves to advance my career. I released my first album titled 'The Vault' on December 2015, and have since released an EP titled 'Primal Waking' which features my best music yet (https://soundcloud.com/pauermusic/sets/primal-waking-ep). I played for the closing ceremonies at Astral Harvest last summer, so I have experience playing at festivals (link: music starts at 05:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FLB4or938&t=564s). I am a competent pianist and am constantly practicing to become the most well-rounded musician I can be (you can check out my instagram for piano clips: https://www.instagram.com/pauermusic).\r\n\r\nMy music could be described as deep rhythmic bass mid-tempo with strong chord progressions and ethereal soundscapes. The set I would throw at your festival would have 'thick midtempo vibes' most likely suited for night-time. Like I said, I am currently dedicating all of my energy towards becoming the best musician I can be, and I genuinely believe that my performance would bring something really special to this festival.",

I can offer a variety of yoga sessions as listed below, let me know which ones you are interested in!\r\n\r\nYin Yoga Sessions - \r\nOne of the styles of yoga I teach and love is yin yoga Yin Yoga is a deeply meditative practice where poses are held for 3 - 5 minutes each in order to begin release of connective tissue I teach classes that focus on certain Meridians in the Chinese Medicine system which correspond to certain elements and organs Each one focuses on a different organ for example the Water Element class focuses on the Kidneys, Wood Element focuses on Liver, ect ect \r\nThe classes are about an hour long and are juicy done in the evening by candlelight But they are lovely anytime of day! These classes can be a really sweet contribution to the festival vibe as they are deeply relaxing and give people an opportunity to come into harmony with themselves and the elements, while having a profound detoxifying effect on the organs\r\n\r\nCakra System Yoga Sessions\r\nI also teach classes centered around the Cakra System These classes focus on different pranayama breathing exercises as well as kriyas energetic cleansing, mudras, and some physical movements and visualizations that charge up the different Cakras I either teach one class which starts at the root cakra and works its way up the Cakras to the top of the head, or I teach different classes which focus specifically on one Cakra the entire time These sessions often leave people feeling energized, clear, and connected to their spirits\r\n\r\nHatha and Vinyasa Flow Sessions -\r\nI also love to teach Hatha flow and Vinyasa flow classes I weave mudras, pranayama and kriyas together with physical classes that range from vigorous Power Vinyasa to mellow Hatha flow These can be nice classes to do early in the day, to get people charged up for the rest of the festival\r\n\r\nThis is what I am willing to offer, any or all of it, depending on what the festival is interested in incorporating! If I can contribute any of those things above, let me know  \r\n\r\nI'm happy to exchange these classes for a festival pass, but depending on the resources of the festival, if it's possible for me to receive payment, as a practicing yoga instructor of course I would apriciate that\r\n\r\nBlessings!\r\nJah Love!\r\nLucy",

        "bio": "I created Koi Chi Healing for all the services I offer, and for this festival I was hoping to offer one of my workshops\r\n\r\nDepending on what your festival needs I have a couple of workshops I'd really like to share with others I have spoken to Kala about my circumstance of dates I will not be able to attend till the 22nd of the festival, and hope what I can offer will be helpful :\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF PERCEPTION EXPRESSION\r\nThis is a 3 hr creative expression/perception expansion workshop! Art supplies will be provided AND you get to take home your creations : will need to have a cap on how many people, preferably around 10-20, can attend as I'll need to get the right number of canvases for people to paint/use/take home\r\n\r\n\"This creative workshop are for those who simply want to express in a judgement-free way through art, all the while gaining new insights and perceptions on creative expression Often people feel that creativity is reserved for the arts, let me tell you it is absolutely not! : I think it is imperative to remember that the word creativity stems from the root word, ��Create�� �� so a scientist who isn��t artistic, is creative when they create a new theory; or a mechanic is creative when they build a motor-run bicycle We are always creating in life So don��t be afraid to create whatever you imagine, this is what this space and workshop is for, to gain a new perspective on creative expression\"\r\n\r\nI created this workshop after my own plant medicine journey with mushrooms & painting and learned so much about the way we perceive expression, communicate our expression, limit our expression and most significantly - how our expression creates perceptions And so I want to share what I've learned, and hope that they too will leave with a new perception about expression It will be 3 hours of laughter, smiles, heart connections, new perspectives, full expressions and authentic selves\r\n\r\nWe will start with introductions as well as our intentions guided by an oracle card draw and an explanation on the purpose of this creative expression workshop, then we will spend a full hour creating freely through paint & mix-media and music I will go around and aid in bringing into consciousness the choices they are making with art, then the final hour will be for sharing and discussion on the different perspectives we receive from other's creations - then the creator will share their original intention\r\n\r\nAll that you need to bring with you are clothing that can get paint on it as you��ll be painting/creating with hands, and come with a positive attitude, open heart & mind\r\n\r\nThe cost per person is $3000 original is $50, but with no tea/snacks - $30 This is negotiable as well though for your festival - this will cover the art supplies used as well as the one you take with you\r\n\r\n_____________________________________\r\n\r\nHEART EXPANSION: I AM TO WE ARE\r\nThis is a 15-2hr workshop - there does not have to be a charge for this workshop I would prefer to keep it down to a size of 10-14 people\r\n\r\nIt is based on the practice of Ho'oponopono, while understanding what oneness feels like on a very intimate and personal level\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to break through the mental understanding/limitations of oneness - to not just simply say \"Namaste,\" \"We are one,\" \"I see you in me,\" etc without truly understanding how it feels to move from the \"I AM\" to \"WE ARE\" To bring this New Earth of wholeness & oneness into reality, the oneness must be tangible to our hearts and body as well\r\n\r\nSo we begin with an introduction/sharing circle of why we have wanted to participate and what we feel like oneness means��; I will also speak briefly of seeing oneness in everything�� Then we will do a short guided meditation, to centre us and open our hearts to the journey we are about to embark on Then we will sit across another person we've never met before and move through the practice of Ho'oponopono \"Goodbye, I'm sorry - Please forgive me, Thank you, I love You\"�� After we will share again how our experiences were Rounding off with a group hug/circle where we place one hand on our hearts and one on the person's heart to the right of us Then end with a OM and Namaste!��\r\n\r\nIf you are short in healing practitioners I can also offer my Crystal Healing and/or Shamballa Reiki as well :\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nI hope that these options will fit with your festival! It would be great to also know what the processes is for the teachers if they are doing it in exchange for a ticket Ie how long, how many times, meals? etc \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nJocelyn Lee\r\nKoi Chi Healing\r\nwwwkoichihealingcom\r\n\r\n",

        "bio": "Hello beautiful people!\r\n8 years ago I graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in honors genetics  At the time I was expected to begin medical school, but I was disillusioned and upset at the little attention that was paid to what we call the placebo  Furthermore, it was difficult to see how any real evidence could be found when the modern medical establishment knows so little about consciousness itself  During my last couple years of my 5 year degree, I could only find a few researchers who were genuinely tackling the problem, and found my higher level genetics professors stumped when I asked questions that reached into the holes at the foundations of modern biology and medical research  There are so many anomalies simply being ignored because they do not fit into the current medical paradigm of reality  These anomalies cause discomfort within the minds of these researchers and doctors, who choose to ignore the science and continue on as though nothing happened, but science is about the pursuit of truth no matter where it takes you\r\nThe last 8 years have led me to every corner of the planet to study with Yogis, Monks, Shamans of the amazon, and to unique and cutting edge research labs all over the States, Canada, and Europe  What I found is a growing body of evidence to show how powerful our minds are when it comes to the manifestation of a strong healthy body, and an increasing number of researchers tackling the question of the placebo in honest, open minded ways  What I also discovered was the huge body of evidence uncovered by physicists over the last 100 years  None of it was taught in any biology classes, which is why modern medical research hasn't the slightest clue about what consciousness really might be  These physicists were never looking for answers to the consciousness riddle, they were trying to uncover the basic workings of the universe, but as a by-product of their curiosity, they have shown us an incredible amount concerning the question of consciousness  Finally a couple years ago, the BBC documentary 'What is Reality' was the first mainstream documentary to attempt to explain to us that it is impossible to understand reality without understanding the role consciousness plays in its creation, and that you are now an outsider in the world of physics if you deny that consciousness has an effect on the physical universe  Nowhere is that more important than with our bodies  We cannot accept the placebo without accepting that the placebo is actually in effect 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that more than anything, our expectations and outlooks for our current and future state of health are what drives the wellness or sickness of our being\r\nIn order to complement my scientific understanding of what is happening between our mind and body, I have studied the mind through psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, NLP, the teachings of Buddhism, and I have trained to teach Yoga and meditation  This workshop is not only about sharing the framework of the new health paradigm coming from science, but to help with the understanding of what we can do to change the beliefs and paradigms we hold in our unconscious  Yoga is not simply a tool to maintain the fitness of the body, as is commonly believed in our western world, but it is a tool to help with mental stress and the creation of positivism  So many of us are stuck in habitual negative mental thought patterns, but there are so many ways to overcome this and take control of our own happiness  Happiness is something that comes from within, from our paradigms and beliefs about the world, and in actuality has nothing to do with outside circumstances, but to the way we react to those circumstances  Through this workshop I try to empower people with not only a framework of knowledge but with some basic tools like visualization meditations to help create this positive state of health  Even at the National Institute of Health, the medical 'old boys' institution in Washington DC, research is coming out weekly to show that we have the power to very specifically up-regulate hormone production or immune response in our bodies through visualization techniques, meditation, and specific yogic asanas \r\nFor the last 2 years, I have been travelling through Australia  I am about to be purchasing a few hundred acres of land in the north okanagan with some friends to start a sustainable farming project with a permaculture and yoga school  Most of Australia, was actually about courses and wwoofing, but I was inspired by the festival scene there  I was enjoying festivals, but felt a desire to give back a little more to the experience  Some friends convinced me I should start hosting workshops, and over the past 2 years I have done over 20 workshops and the workshop has evolved with every experience\r\nI have learned that the most effective way to share this understanding is to lead the workshop as a guided group discussion  I have the framework, the knowledge, and the depth of examples and experiences to share that I could speak for hours in front of a group, but with something so sensitive that every one of us has so much personal experience and perspective on, Ive found that encouraging as much discussion and sharing from the group is a far more effective way to get the point across  That being said, Ive learned several techniques which have helped me maintain order in a discussion that can bring up so many emotions\r\nAt the moment I am very busy starting a community futures small business program to help me avoid any mistakes with this big project, and searching for property  I am however happy to answer any questions you might have  I still dont have a website, although a friend is helping me slowly build one, and there is no formal presentation or powerpoint I can send you  \r\nIf you have a projector, it would help me get a few points across with short videos I have on my computer, but those are not necessary either  At the festivals in Australia, I was generally given an hour and half or two hours, although I spoke to several communities where the discussion  reached almost four hours  2 hours is more than enough though  Ive done the workshop on beaches, under festival tents, and in large rooms, so the location doesn't really matter, what matters most is the intimacy and a space where we can be uninterrupted for the time of the workshop  \r\nI understand that this letter is coming a bit late, but there is no problem for me to join you guys if you have a bit of space you want filled up  The subject of the workshop is unique and has always excited people, and the main purpose I have in sharing is to empower people to understand the mind body connection so that they can live a healthy life  It has been 4 years since the last time I was sick, and this is something I am hoping to help others realize is possible\r\nThanks, and Im looking forward to hearing back from you\r\nChris Pisesky\r\n",

For many people, ethical and honest non monogamy is about freedom: freedom to love who you want, when you want, in whatever way feels authentic between adults and is mutually consensual It has a rosy reputation for being about not putting limitations on whom or how you love, being able to acknowledge your needs and desires and dreams, knowing that to expect one person alone to fulfill all of them is way too much pressure \r\n\r\nBut what's the reality? How do the myths differ from the practical applications? How does it actually work in real life? Is non monogamy some enlightened approach to living, or simply another set of options for relating to other humans? Is there a Golden Path to polyamorous perfection, or is it a multilinear dance where we each get to decide what works for us as individuals? \r\n\r\nWhether honest non-monogamy is new to you, or you have years of experience, this workshop promises to offer fresh and insightful perspectives, and empower you with new tools to assist you in enjoying more fulfilling relationships!\r\n",

I am trying to get out there to gain more experience with my work and think that it would add a great, unique workshop to your lineup! I look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nLove and Light",

        "bio": "My name is Andrea and I am very interested in your festival both as an instructor and vendor  I am a 200 RYT with additional certifications in Yin, Vinyasa and Stand Up Paddle Board Yoga  I am currently going to school at the Vancouver School of Bodywork & Massage until mid June and had to take a break from teaching  Just prior to starting school I was teaching regular classes at Yogacara Whistler and Tadasana Yoga in Pemberton as well as taught in Jasper, AB for four years before moving to Pemberton in February 2015\r\n\r\nIn addition to teaching yoga, I also own my own business, Yoga Gypsy Creations  I hand create and sell yoga inspired jewelry mala beads and accessories such as lavender eye pillows, yoga mat bags, and a line of aromatherapy products such as yoga mat spray, body & massage oil, soaps and candles  I had a booth at the Squamish Farmer's Market all of last summer season  I am hoping to sell my creations again this summer at the market  \r\n\r\nI would be so interested in being a part of your festival   I have recently started hosting Mala & Mantra Workshops in the Sea to Sky corridor I have one planned for Apr 23 at Yogacara and one in Vancouver on Apr 9 with an instructor from my school and her friends  I hosted two workshops in Pemberton last Fall with two separate stagette groups and they were a hit!!!\r\n\r\nThe following is the description of the workshop that I am hosting at Yogacara\r\n\r\nMala & Mantra Creative Workshop\r\nIn this special workshop you will create your very own Mala and then learn to use various mantras to bring about healing, peace, love and health Repeating mantras while using a Mala helps to cultivate and deepen a meditation practice This ancient practice enables one to release negative energy and to receive all that is positive and good in life We will end the workshop with an asana/yoga practice and all you need to do is come with an open heart to send out and receive positive energy\r\n\r\nSince the workshop would require the cost of mala beads and supplies, I  am not certain that I could offer the workshop in exchange for a festival pass  I am definitely interested in a trade of some sort but my supplies would need to be covered  I would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this if you are interested in the idea  \r\n\r\nThank you for your time\r\n\r\nNamaste,\r\nAndrea\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

We can empower ourselves and our communities by working in consensus to create the decisions without pushing an agenda on anyone We can use circles and mutual respect to create an intention for collaboration, while moving forward decisions quickly and in alignment\r\n\r\n3 The Mutualism Hub - Social enterprise networking! Let's share what we do in circle, what we have to offer in abundance, and what we are looking for assistance with If we come from a place of service to Mother Earth, we can manifest in an ethical way! \r\n\r\n4 Ecovillages as Living Conscious Community Centres - What are ecovillages and intentional communities really doing? They are holding space to innovate on all levels of society, from the local community within the village, to the surrounding community, to the global peace pilgrammage currently occuring We are coming together as a species and beings around the planet to create a new story that is based on peace, acceptance, love, trust, and true justice Ecovillages are the sanctuary and consciousness hubs that are anchoring this space for us to connect and create the future we want \r\n\r\n",

Can we tap into the natural world to reveal the mysteries of light and the shadow, what is at play? Can we hear the moments that invite us to pause long enough to catch the next wave? Can we harmonize with our surroundings?  If we are in tune with our environment, the planet, astral bodies, and our being can we empower ourselves through harmony to create a paradigm that supports and honors life?  We will reflect upon our harmony and balance within our ecosystem, as possible pathways for greater inner peace  Many of us are already living in a closer connection to the rhythmic nature of the natural world This workshop will give language to and empower our capacity for healthy shifts by being that which is true to our hearts  As the workshop draws to a close an assignment will be designated to participants to adventure into the natural environment and have a conversation with there surroundings, tools, tips and guidance will be offered for this exercise The exercise is a medium for raising our capacity to have a thriving relationship with the natural world and developing our capacity to harmonize and create from this place of connection Time is not a force we must work against rather a reflection that can serve us in harmonizing our intentions and actions with the great cosmic symphony of existence ",

We will then dive into the main focus of the workshop, 2 case studies The first is a look at the declining industry of physical print design vs against the ever growing digital graphic design industry This will lay out what some people already know about sustainability, which is the environmental part But in the next case study, the story of a sustainable restaurant in Vancouver BC that is striving to stay above water in tough times while battling against the corporate chains that just feed on profits This topic will help to grow everyones understanding of what it means to be \"sustainable\", over catch phrases like \"going green, or being environmental/social conscious\" This will cover most of the lecture, if there are not too many questions throughout this period and time is going well, another case study or example will be presented to further expand upon the subject From there we will participate in a second group exercise where we come up with ideas in small groups of products of ideas we can make more sustainable using the information we just learned There will be a short conclusion and information given on where to find out more, and time for final questions at the end\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the key notes addressed will be:\r\n-The definition of sustainability, ��Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs��\r\n-The three pillars of sustainability: enivronmentally sound economically viable, and socially just\r\n-The principles of sustainable design: learning from natural systems, respect for energy/resources, respect for people, respect for place, respect for future, and systems thinking\r\n-practical steps designers can take to make a difference: design for use, dematerialization, design for disassembly, substution, localization, transmaterialization, design for durability, design for reuse unintended & intended, and redesigning the system \r\n-Setting up sustainable framework, ie: LCAlife cycle assessment, The Green table Network, Oceanwise certification, making your own DIY\r\n\r\nA little about myself: I am a Sustainable Graphic Designer that grew up in Vancouver, BC I Studied at the vancouver art institute and graduated with a Bachelors of applied design, minoring in sustainability I have been working freelance for the last year and a bit now, and before that I worked in a firm and some corprate positions ",

Integrating sensuality, letting go of the fear and coming back to beauty of the senses which are a doorway towards connecting with the divine\r\n\r\nHere is a link for the last workshop i offered at the ''Conscious Goddess Festival'' at the same location a few weeks ago  You can find testimonials and more: http://theconsciousgoddessfestivalcom/#9946ef84-42bb-cl\r\n\r\nI will co-facilitate this workshop with my partner James Thomas\r\n\r\n",

For anyone that doesn't know, poi spinning can be considered a circus flow art and involves spinning weighted balls on the end of strings, usually one in each hand Poi spinning originated as a Maori tradition to improve warriors wrist/arm flexibility and dexterity, and has now developed into a performance art, with fire performance and urban street circus being two major forms\r\nI have personally been spinning poi for two years now, having performed with both fire and LED poi at various events, including the Whistler Blackcomb Fire and Ice shows I have also spent many hours teaching poi to various people including friends and more formal arrangements I can offer instruction right from complete beginner moves up to advanced techniques, performance considerations and improving general flow In terms of workshops I am happy to offer multiple workshops at different standards or just adapt to the class based on demand\r\nI am an avid yoga enthusiast and mostly follow the Ashtanga practice although I have enjoyed many Iyengar and Hatha classes I would love the opportunity to be a part of and contribute to this event as I feel that is the best way to experience festivals\r\nI hope you can consider my application, I look forward to hearing back from you!\r\nPeace, love and my warmest regards,\r\nSamuel Scott",

I have never been to a festival before and would love for Blessed Coast to be my first. I would love even more to be able to contribute to this wonderful community of art, music and food set in the beautiful Squamish Valley by volunteering my time. I hope to meet like minded souls and friends who share a love for our beautiful coast as well as creators of art and experiences that bring people together.

My friend works there, and I love the community at the studio. I would love to volunteer with the yoga team at Blessed Coast, as a thank you to the yoga practice in general, all of my instructors, fellow yogis for helping me overcome many battles. I would love to learn from amazing yogis about their stories, and help bring a similar sense of supportive community that I feel at Moksha in Squamish. I also am new to Squamish and want to help out and get to know the community more!\n\nI am also passionate about the local community. One of the amazing things about Squamish is the connections and support that exists within this town. Local food, music, businesses don't seem to battle but do everything they can to support one another, which makes Squamish such an amazing place to live. Blessed Coast seems to have a similar objective in helping local community organizations and people connect with one another to create opportunities for growth, connectivity, and improvement of overall health.\n\nI am passionate about what Blessed Coast strives to do and would love the opportunity to help in any way with this event. \n\nThank you for reading through my application, and I hope to connect!\n\nCarrie",

The people, the music, the connections  all blew my mind and heart wide open. This year, I want to be a part of this. I want more people to experience what I have last year, and I feel my spark will add to the overall Glow <3",

I have many fun loving skills and talents that I can put forth! I love having fun, smiling, dancing, and putting people in great moods, that my positive attitude reflects so much into my environment :) \nI have experience of working outdoors in nature and helping preserve it, as well as, volunteering at large festivals and conferences with crowds up to 50,000 or more, working as security, marketing, setting up/taking down tents, information booths and greeting people, saging and smudging people, dancing to help create a happy vibe (if people aren't dancing, i usually help start set the vibe).\nI work in an environment daily in Vancouver where I am serving thousands of people weekly from all over the world. I work at Cannabis Culture Vapor Lounge and Dispensary where I am helping serve the public and help create the positive atmosphere. I help host and set up a popular open mic at the vapor lounge twice a week, where I am surrounded by artists, dancers, and musicians, and help create space for them to express themselves.\nI am confident that I am able to help in so many ways, and willing to learn :)\nI can help any days and willing to help out as much as needed and more <3\nmuch love, and hope to hear from you soon\nVicky",

I have felt a fire light up within this community that I had only glimpses of in my previous life, a feeling of my tribe, home comfort. To play a key role in this building of connection back to our own hearts within such a safe and accepting container to be able to heal, and to spread the message of One Love to the world is something that ignites my Spirit in a way that is FULL of prayer held with connection to my ancestors, for all my future generations. \nWith all my delight & gratitude for all your offerings\nAsha Ley\n",

Music is incredibly healing in all kinds of ways, and I would love to take part in this again, with others.

So people can really express themselves in all their being, connect to each other, give, receive and share, have a good time and live communally together for the time of the festival, sharing space, experiences, music, movement, connections. Ever since I started volunteering for festivals I found my way to experience a festival by not only enjoying an amazing time but also by getting engaged and contribute.

I found community for the first time in my life and I fell In love instantly. \nBlessed coast hits all these marks in relation to what I love doing most. Just expressing and being, loving and laughing and sharing!!!! \n\nI recently underwent a huge surgery on my leg and it�s left me rather stagnant during recovery..coming into my body and having to re learn my practises all over again. A slow, yet beautiful process. \n\nBlessed coast will literally be the very first thing I will be doing for myself, my body, my spirit since my surgery. Up untill the festival starts I will just be recovering and honouring this time. \n\nIt would mean the entire world to be surrounded in this environment once I�m mobile and travelling around again. \nThis is exactly what my spirit needs during this time! \n\nI WANT TO BE AN INFLUENCIAL PART OF THIS FAMILY AND EXPERIANCE. \nNamaste.

(she (we) couldn't go without a volunteer ticket because at the moment for us as germans it is not easy to find work at the island so we can't efford. Especially for her it's very sad because all her friends are there. I love festivals and often do volunteer work at german festivals to support them.

It was so nice to come back and find out that similar communities and gatherings are here. I grew up in something far from it in honesty. I value unity, coming together on the basis of love, respect and peace. The energy created at these gatherings is magic and truly healing. It's hard to describe in words. After learning about Blessed coast and researching the festival, it truly resonated with me. It is definitely the type of community that I want to be part of.",
