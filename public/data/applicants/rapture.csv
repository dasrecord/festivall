I was on the executive committee for the Junior High Leadership Conference in 2014, which was an event for over 500 students. For that event, I had to contact vendors and also  organizes them the day of. My responsibilities also included emceeing the event and leading a spirit team of 25 students. As well, I organized and ran a smaller event of about 100 people for Key Club International's Western Canada District Convention. That was a two-day convention that I, along with my Kiwanis liaison, completely planned from the ground up, including contacting possible venue locations, caterers, attendees, and various other vendors. Those two experiences showed my the technical/practical skills I would need to succeed as an Event Planner, but one of the most important skills that you can't teach is how to just have fun with it and be excited about what you're planning. I have found that when planning events, people can tell the day of if the event planner was really involved in the idea and passionate about every detail that went into it. And day-of, people at the event can tell whether or not the person who is running the show loves what they are doing. ","My idea of a great party would be lots of people who are there to dance, have drinks, and just all around have a great time. There would definitely be a dance floor right in front of some huge speakers/a DJ, (because I can't help but dance around while listening to good music.)

It is with great excitement that I am writing to apply for the Events Marketing Manager position featured on the LinkedIn

Firstly, I have been fortunate to wear many hats in my short 10 years within the Business and Marketing world. As a result, I have very solid foundations allowing me to understand all aspects of the decision making process. I have the unique ability to manage multidisciplinary projects and to navigate complex challenges. However, actual experience has taught me that my professional values are aligned with organisation, dedication & adaptability.

I consider myself an articulate and self-motivated individual who draws on my ability to think analytically in order to exhibit leadership skills at all times. I pride myself on taking initiative, communicating in a variety of contexts, tackling business tasks hands on and thinking outside the box. I have exceptional oral communication and interpersonal skills with the ability to multi-task to ensure business requirements are successfully executed to a high standard.

For the greater part of my Communications career, I have worked in Marketing Management and I have a dual degree in Business and Communications (Majors: Marketing and Public Relations) gaining invaluable experience in a number of industries both in Australia and London.

I strive for personal excellence in all that I do and place great importance on continually developing myself both personally and professionally. My work ethic reflects that I am pro-active and a diligent individual who thrives on successfully implementing innovative business ideas and achieving corporate goals. My experience has allowed me to gain skills in organising and planning both people and a diverse range of campaigns and then ensuring the successful promotion of communication of key messages to target audiences.

I have developed various skills including leading and managing teams, confidently problem solving at an executive level as well as directing professional strategies towards the profitable growth and operation of businesses whilst ensuring they reflect the longer-term objections and priorities.

Any feedback about my professional demeanor has always been positive, in what may seem to be intimidating environments, particularly when dealing with staff, clients, the media and competitors. I have been acknowledged for maintaining integrity and dignity under fire whilst remaining competent, confident and always approachable, particularly with handling clients in turmoil.

If offered a position, I will continue my highest standard of enthusiasm that I have consistently displayed throughout my career and I will provide a positive attitude in everything I do.  I can be sponsored under the E3 Non Immigrant Visa, which can be easily arranged and requires no financial backing. 

Please find attached a copy of my resume, which will give you a more detailed summary of my knowledge, experience and skills. 

  I look forward to the opportunity of discussing these further at interview and can be contacted on +61432 559  377 at any time.      

Yours Sincerely,                Amber Diamond

I prefer working in a startup environment because performance and contribution is more noticeable, and the potential of being a key team member is more appealing to me than being a mere number within a highly structured corporate atmosphere. I am also attracted to being able to immerse myself in several roles, and add value to different processes in the organization.","An entrepreneur is someone that is self-motivated, goal-oriented and target driven.

I was able to successfully plan, manage and execute these events to the highest standards. This, coupled with my Marketing education and work experience, solidifies my confidence in being able to communicate and deliver a great successful service.","A great party to me is directly related to the satisfaction level of the client. Given that the events industry is highly experiential, being successful in throwing a party, means the event was ran safely, with minimal to no challenges, and contributed towards a positive overall experience to all parties involved.","Being a DJ and Music Producer, with over 7 years of experience, I am heavily involved in the Electronic Music and Underground Nightlife scenes in Montreal. I successfully ran several event series' in the city's top clubs and venues, that played host to a number of different local and international talent. I am also an avid Vinyl-Record collector with an impressive collection, and find myself involved in the record/crate digging scene all over.","Although I do not micro-manage, I always make sure that staff are performing the tasks well. Based on my experience, I am very confident in my ability to manage different size teams, and keep them motivated throughout events. I have excellent communication and am highly emotionally intelligent, so I know I can get across and direct teams very well, even in a decentralized environment."

In the mean time I would ask them to note down key points that people would ask them about the event which they can answer if asked. I would assign one of my core team member to be around them and tackle if the situation is getting out of control.

I have experiences in event management and execution from 2008 (Philip Morris), after that 2nd biggest publishing house in my country(Mlada Fronta) and then big events for Burda International for my responsible brands like ELLE, MAXIM or MARIECLAIRE.","Allright then (: , ...It's from my life like few months ago... I got opportunity to work in Canada...Even when I had a great position, leading over 30 people, with my fiancee I accepted that... So we started over 1 year preparations (we took pet with us, sold everything etc...). We came to Canada to our first spot, so it was Vancouver. Unfortunately, after few days we decided to leave and move to Toronto. But you can't even imagine how it could be hard with over 6 suitcases, dog kennel, golf clubs, fiancee and dog (-. . So, we decided to ride...5500km in 7 days. In the morning I was loading stuff in car I thought that I'm really crazy. But, after all nerves - it was amazing trip with a lot of unexpected experiences... I made an video from it (wish can you post it). So, it isn't like a funny joke, but it was a crazy life situation, I can honestly tell you (-.","I found you on internet when I was looking for job and I was impressed by your references and reputation. Even your websites and events you are planning, it's more than amazing. That's absolutely the reason why I'm applying!","I absolutely have! Some of my achievements- In Burda International I was on my own (even if I was selling) doing event for 250 agency leaders. In Philip Morris, we made events for 2000 people with brand like Marlboro or L&M. In Mlada Fronta and Evropa Real Estate I was running on my own golf tours for Developers and VIP clients - in total over 30 golf tournaments all over the country.",,"I'm really team player, with strong time management. I like to work in both types of companies (I have experiences in both of them). Startups are very good if they have good point and great team. Can rise from zero to 1000% in few months and it's really exciting. Big companies (I worked in three of them) are of course better with their hinterland. They might be strong, leaders (for example Burda International with ELLE was). What could be an disadvantage - if you are working in international company with management abroad, sometimes the strategy is global and you can't do anything even if it's not the best option.","Man or Woman on the right place, with clear objectives, team player but strong self-leading person. Of course, it must be person who has ideas and can realize them (both of it is more than important)","It's a party which hasn't been seen yet. It's a gig where people are staying in front of entry and can't wait to get in. It's an event where you see satisfaction on customers or visitors even when you look at them. It isn't easy to make this party, but I can honestly say that I made plenty of them and it was biggest satisfaction for myself (even if it was stressy and hard)","It depends on the concrete situation. If it's before event like last-minute sales or sales like 1 week before. But evidently I will try to do fast training to push them to sell better. If there is not a lot of time, I will try to mobilize a new sales team or try to help them on my own."

I believe this is an essential quality to have when undertaking a position within a company as it is imperative to maintain quality team work and service delivery even with fewer members of staff. 
 Having working in the Health and Safety/customer service environment for 15 years+ I am fully aware of the changing customer needs and the underlying importance of providing a professional image of a company at all times. My results are consistent and above targets and I pride myself on having impeccable organisational skills and the ability to address issues as and when they arise. 
 Reporting to the CEO and UK Operations Managers, UK Health and Safety department to achieve a high standard of Health and Safety/Quality in all areas. Also to ensure the ongoing implementation of Health, Safety and Quality standards with all suppliers overseas, to ensure the FTO guidelines are adhered. Attending court claims when necessary to and to assist with the investigation of legal claims. 
 My current as Director of Sales Marketing and pervious position of Head of Business Development has given me further insight into the operational side of the Events/Travel business and the necessary skills to manage varying roles. Combining this with experience gained from having worked overseas for nearly 11 years, I believe that I possess a sound understanding of the challenges a growing business may present. 
 A position within your company will not only benefit my personal development but offer your company a sound quality individual who will work to ensure that the your company continues to deliver and achieve its targets for the coming year.",,,,,
