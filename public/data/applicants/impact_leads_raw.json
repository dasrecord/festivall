Then I transmit that into my music with my primary focus being how I can have a positive impact with what I say. I may not be the only one trying to do that but I certainly bring my own flavour and style to it based on my experience. Especially when it comes to speaking on mental health issues.",

In the beginning, RogueEffect explored more chilled out types of Electronic Music like House and Trance, then in late 2014 got really into the mesmerizing beats of Bass Music (Mid-Tempo, Bass House, Dubstep, Trap, and Freeform).\r\n\r\nIf you catch RogueEffect at a live show you’ll be seriously impressed by the amount of genres he laces out. Truly a real Deejay and crowd hyper. RogueEffect has crushed festivals, clubs, raves, and parties all over the Kootenay’s, and surrounding area. There is no stopping this powerhouse of nasty bass that makes your face melt and booty drop.",

Driving our awakening are myriad signals from the external world that we are in trouble and in need of a new consciousness and paradigm to govern the human condition, one that unites us in the heart and soul of oneness.  \r\nSpurring this need for a new paradigm is the perennial, and often times, tragic issue of inequality on multiple levels, lack of freedom, a global pandemic, racial unrest, climate change, and a political and economic system that is in decay, sick, and dying.  The issues, challenges, and sickness found in our external world reflects the internal, collective consciousness, and sickness of humanity.  In this talk I will address how this internal climate is created and provide a vision and solutions for the creation of a healthier planet and  humanity that is designed by sacred activists and leaders who are ready for real change.",

What I have found is that some MEN that are artistic ... don't know how to give their gifts and keep their balls intact when it comes to woman. Women have conditioned men to be okay with just giving up or finding a neutral solution, instead of penetrating their deep hearts. So now we have very masculine women and very feminine men--not what we want, if there is to be sexual polarity in love relationships. I would like to explore this group with my offering of the differences between us and engaging the true masculine when it is needed in LOVE relationships.",

I call this path \"The original teachings\". \r\n\r\nThese teachings are simple but powerful ways that teach us a healthy relationship with ourselves, with all living and also very importantly, with the spirit world. \r\n\r\nWhen we practice these sets of instructions we're able to gain a wider sense of understanding of our reality and thereby achieve higher levels of consciousness that will lead us to a conscious life of beauty.\r\n\r\nI want to participate and contribute to this event because I resonate with its vision and because I believe in this times of awakening, we have a great opportunity to assist Mother Earth and our human family in this planetary transformation that we all going through with the use of the internet.",

The frequency of shows, both solo (Curious Sounds) and as a duo (Tall Handsome Club) has led to the rapid development of blending groovy, deep bass lines but holding bias to vocal and instrument based tracks. Curious Sounds, evicting emotions and bringing friends old and new together on the dance floor.",

We are ascending into a fifth dimensional reality based on the frequency of love and its imperative for all of us to know how to access and navigate these waters, retrieving these new energies that are in this planet waiting for us to access.  There is universal magic interwoven through our souls  with infinite access for all  to create with.  I would like to share with the world how to do it now. To create a united experience to  ascend into the fifth dimensional reality whereas most of the human population is sitting in fourth dimension.

His friend Brent Griffin (Dj Spindok) introduced him to the software virtual dj and he was hooked after that.\r\nit is my whole life. I have never known a life without great passion for music and not just Djing but the sound frequency spectrum in general. Ever since I was born my mother knew I was intrigued with sound so she taught me how to play the piano at the age of 10 to just under 11 but sadly she passed away shortly after. However I carried the talent she gave me forward and I always told my self and her that I would do something huge with my talent such as helping the first nations long houses around the world and struggling bands across Canada, invest in environmental protection inventors, and invest in life skills program for those struggling with mental illness. That is just the beginning of the list of how I will use my talent.",

Other DJs play it, Hardwell,\r\nSteve Aoki, Morgan Page, Arty.

This cultural background informs Allya’s eclectic and varied musical taste. While House is his muse, it’s only natural that he would expand his horizons, and expand them he does; Breaks, Bass, Glitch Hop, and Ghetto Funk have all played a part in making Allya the versatile DJ he is today. Even edgier genres like Psy, Hardstyle and Trap have a place in his heart, his mind ever open to new possibilities in this brave new world of cross-genre pollination. Once play-listed by some of the genres’ heaviest hitters for his Trance and Hard Dance records, he returns to the production realm after spending the last few years with his attention devoted to co-running Awakened Music Festival here in western Canada. So far 2020 has seen the release of “Side Effects” on Sheppard Records - just the first of a string of records dropping this year.",

He's shared the stage with international and local artists such as TMSV, Madam X, EarthGang, D Double E, Lady Chann, Compa, Skeptical, Ekali, Greazus, & Lighta! Sound. His productions sit in the low end realm with a cinematic, deep, melodic feel that touch on mixing organic elements and instrumentation into its moving rhythms.

Her single “Magnetic Hills” from her debut EP is set to release on July 17th, with her full EP releasing on the 31st.\r\n\r\nGrowing up as a jazz/blues singer, DESI has always experimented with making her own music, just her and the piano. Yet, unearthing her instincts for producing, and surrendering herself was what really catapulted her into the next stage. Instantly she collided her past - inviting melodies and intricate song writing, with her present - a bass music fixation. Her eccentric concoction offers us a highly rhythmic, vocal centric, bass affair. Each track, a conceptual offering to its listener; DESI leaves no trace of uncertainty in the recipient's mind as to it’s meaning. Whether she’s traversing 85, 140, or 170 BPM, DESI uses every opportunity to submerge herself in an assortment of bass music styles.",

What sets me apart from other DJ's is being very versatile and playing to the crowd - not one RDGE set is ever the same and always contains different genres catered to any crowd. I'm constantly working on finding the freshest tunes, whether they are well known or not, or underground selections that no one knows. One of the most exciting things for me is seeing reactions to the music I play and people asking me what song that was as it helps me highlight new genres and new artists for other people to enjoy! I also create a ton of new mashups/edits for every show so every experience is different than the last. I believe my ability to allow the music to speak for itself and breathe creates a unique experience and atmosphere that I would love to bring to Impact festival once again, for an absolutely incredible cause.",

Spending many nights digging for the vibe and feel that rang true to him, he found his home deep-rooted in techno and House. Though he's been known to throw down sets from deep house to downtempo, from groovy funk all the way to progressive psy, he's best known for music on side of deep and dirty... and his deep connection to the driving bass of techno  and the groove of house music, he always makes the dance floor bounce.\r\nOver the years, he has played clubs and events all over Southern Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and down to Chicago and New York, including residencies at System Soundbar and Tonic (Toronto), and playing venues like The Government(Toronto),  Stereo(Montreal), Crobar and Pacha(NYC), Habitat Living Sound(Calgary), and festivals such as WEMF,  Burning Man, Eclipse, OM, Fozzyfest, Sub Lunar and Treemendus. \r\nHe’s shared stages with Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Johnny Fiasco, Timu Mass",

Why being vulnerable and asking for support is so hard at times? \r\n\r\nYou are not alone. So many of us still fear our full self expression, and our gifts. In fact, most of us do and it being with the beliefs we created about ourselves and the world around us in our childhood. \r\n\r\nIt can be hard to believe that those beliefs are still with us. The curious part is just how 95% of our actions are controlled by those very same beliefs. \r\n\r\nJoin us, as we explore how to shift our core beliefs, so we can show up as our whole and authentic selves in the world today. We are ready to see female leaders embrace their fullness and step out. Especially those who are modelling the possibilities for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will dive into a 3 step process that will help you begin your own path towards discovering how old beliefs from your childhood may be running your adult life.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will run 90 minutes. Please bring with you a pen and paper. Everyone is welcome.",

Though much of my time was spent in corporate and then as an entrepreneur, on the treadmill, feeding into the patterns from my own inter generational patterns, my past experiences gave me exactly the perspective that has allowed me to step into a vision of supporting parents who feel stuck, with no way out of their pain, their doubt, their hurts that are then transmitted to their children. The parent-child relationship is at the root of all of humanity's sustainability, yet we tend to ignore our core healing in exchange for band aid solutions on the outside. So the invitation we bring forward is for parents to step into their truest life, their joy, and their freedom, so they can support their children in being their most authentic selves. Without this path being paved ahead, we will be sure to stay enmeshed in the vicious and painful cycles of struggle that are currently in as a humanity.",

        "personal_statement": "Something that definitely sets me apart from most applicants is that I produce my own original electronic music, and have legitimate music credentials with a Bachelor of Music degree and Royal Conservatory diploma in piano performance. I can perform complete sets of my own original music. Most of my tracks have original lyrics and vocals that I have co-written with local artists. I also believe my music reaches a high standard of quality, having had a nomination for 2017 Electronic Recording of the Year at the Edmonton Music Awards, FM radio play across Canada and the US on 110+ stations with many top 10 airplay chartings in the electronic genres, several Beatport Staff Picks, Top 10s, and a Featured Track, and features and interviews by reputable electronic music blogs like WeRaveYou.com. \r\n\r\nI am a highly motivated individual, working closely with several other well-respected artists and industry members. I recently launched an events company with Thug Shells (Michelle Leus) called Vibe Raiders, we had a successful Valentine's party and are planning 3-4 events per year. I am a crew member/resident DJ for FancyFoxx Music/The Womp and recently attended Amsterdam Dance Event conference with Frank Olaya and Adriana Briceno of MonkeyTwerk. I produce music with RamJamSam (Sam Eid) and our first original, \"There's a Rumor\" is being released on March 22, 2020. I do a few shows a year with Cheshire Productions in Edmonton. \r\n\r\nIn addition I am also a practicing medical doctor with 5 years of specialty training in psychiatry, so I come with a unique perspective, being fully immersed in the the medical profession and mental health world, as well as decades of experience and involvement as a musician. I recently spoke about artist mental health at the 2019 Alberta Electronic Music conference and for Canada's Music Incubator AE West program. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a open-minded, respectful, responsible, mental-health focussed, out-of-the-box thinker, with clean and consistent branding, sets of almost entirely original music, often with a live vocalist, consider me for your 2020 festival!",

We really want to take a piece of what we do at BiTF and bring it to the wider rave community - compared to other available local acts I feel that we put in a *lot* of time to deliver a quality set and experience.  Every festival we have played has really been a distinct standout, and since we're just starting out, we need your help to gain that recognition for what we put into our art.  For the community, for a friends, and everybody else putting in the time to make this happen.  We're hoping to debut newly produced material this summer and Impact would be a sick spot to do it.",

Returning home, Mullin began working towards creating tracks that captured this atmosphere, a goal that continues to remain central to his music a decade later. \r\n\r\nWith Internal Frequency continually hitting new milestones on social media as bass heads from around the world take notice, he continues to foster the growth of his own community of followers with free releases, live streams, and layers of slow, hulking bass that channel the frequencies of the universe.",

        "personal_statement": "There are a couple reasons I believe I should be selected to perform at IMPACT festival. First and foremost is my dedication and passion towards music.  \r\n\r\nCreating music is one of the few things in my life that I've broken through the wall so to speak.  With most things I've taken up I've been content with mediocre, with giving up on learning because it was too difficult, because the effort to progress was more than my desire to progress. With music and creating though I have an insatiable desire to learn and grow and in the process, pass on the knowledge I have gained to friends and people who reach out. I've had more 3-5 hrs of sleep nights in the last 5 years of this journey then not. I have a family the comes first and had a job before the quarantine and the only thing i was willing to sacrifice to learn music production was sleep. No matter how tired I am, how beaten down by the day I am, I move forward on my musical journey, even if it's just a step that day and if that's not passion I don't know what is.\r\n\r\nThe other reason I believe I should be selected to perform is the style of music I create. I believe my take on dubstep is unique and fresh. I blend elements of deep and heavy dubstep and combine them with lush melodies that glue these elements together.   Though I believe my music is more towards the deep/low side of dubstep I don't hear a lot of music that sounds like what I make.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration and regardless of the decisions made I will be tuning in to the festival and donating what I can to help out the Artists.",

For us, the true power of music lies in its ability to reach across societal lines and bring people together.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the Lower Mainland, we’ve always felt that despite the “No Fun City” label, Vancouver is home to a vibrant artistic community… but as artists, we face so many hurdles in trying to cultivate safe and inclusive community spaces. Both at home and internationally, corporations mistreat their audiences by failing to book diverse lineups, having inadequate approaches to harm reduction, or failing to have responsible environmental policies. \r\n\r\nMuch like IMPACT, the PHASE SHIFT project was born out of a desire to do something more. Our vision is to foster the vibrant electronic music scene in BC and beyond while staying true to the heart and soul of electronic music culture by cultivating diversity, harm reduction, and environmental sustainability at all of our shows. We believe that our mission is closely aligned with the values of IMPACT festival, and we would be honoured to #makeIMPACT by sharing our music and our knowledge with the IMPACT community.",

        "personal_statement": "I would love the opportunity to play at Impact festival for two main reasons. First, I grew up in a small town in northern British Columbia called Prince Rupert. My family is of mixed heritage: my mom is First Nations and my dad has European ancestry. Prince Rupert is not always the most progressive place, and I grew up rejecting my Indigenous ancestry, customs, and family. When I moved to Vancouver for university, I finally became connected to my culture, because I met strong Indigenous role models and advocates. This was at the same time that I started to listen to electronic music, which I instantly fell in love with. I've always been drawn to the darker sounds of EDM, and it was pretty easy to tell that all of the bass and dubstep producers back then were all male. However, things have changed now, more and more women are starting to break into the industry and represent Canada and BC! People like Rezz and Whipped Cream are international stars, while we also have local, rising talents like Sheevs throwing down at Red Room. I want to play at Impact Fest to highlight the inclusivity of EDM and that it welcomes all people, no matter your heritage, culture, or gender. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I have admired Impact Festival from its first year. Although the current health crisis has led to an uprising in the number of charity events, Impact Fest was a true pioneer. From its inception it wanted to be different. As such, I tried to incorporate that same ethos into the mix I submitted for this application. As of yet, I haven't been able to produce a track of my own, but I have been diligently using Ableton Live to create my own unique edits and mash ups. I believe that the recipe for an unforgettable DJ set is to incorporate a bit of the old, the comfortable, and the known but present it in a new way, with a new twist. I created this set for you to showcase my range and that I am comfortable at, and changing between, many different BPMs. Ultimately, DJ Beer is about the inclusivity of EDM, showcasing local talent, female DJs and producers, and reaffirming to the world that girls can throw down too.",

During his time enrolled in the Music and Computer Science program at the University of Victoria, he has developed a keen ear towards the recording arts and has dedicated thousands of hours towards studio work, DJing, and event production.\r\n\r\nCurrently living in Victoria, BC, Craylic spends as much time as possible involving himself in the West Coast Bass Music scene, whether it be through organizing events, producing music, or performing at events. His work has been showcased several times on 101.9fm CFUV Radio Victoria, and has performed alongside artists such as Leo Zen, Konka, Lasu, Akela, Payne, JRoy, Nalla, and Bad Rabbit, among others. His newest project, Formula DnB, is an effort to keep 170 culture alive and thriving in Victoria, BC.",

That being said, we have gathered a following of more than 300 people and have done our best to respond proactively.\r\n\r\nSince having to cancel our first show, I have been streaming live sets regularly on multiple channels, and have also launched a series called Formula Radio which features DnB artists throughout Vancouver Island and BC. We have also recently started taking donations, and while we haven't made much, I am proud to say that we are putting 80% of donations made are going towards a food bank in Victoria.\r\n\r\nDue to these recent events, my understanding of the initiatives Impact puts forward, as well as my commitment to the music community and DJing, I think that I would be a good fit to work with Impact on future projects.",

But he knows he wouldn't be able to do it without those close to him. The massive support from everyone at Footwerk, The Beatlab, as well as countless other individuals and fans help make any dream a reality. Always aiming higher, we cant wait to see what new heights Wes Please reaches from here.",

        "bio": "Levi Nicoll (aka L Nix) is no stranger to the bass music scene with releases spanning a decade. Hailing from Nelson BC Canada Levi started the craft in 2005. For a long time junglist it was natural to start with drum and bass and took to it with passion. It was about 2008 when L Nix heard the true inviting nature of dubstep and has been releasing it in one form or another. Whether it via the duo Orbatak or solo most of the dubstep was much more distorted, harder and heavy bass related production. It was roughly 2012 when L Nix made the change into the more intelligent and mature deep dark sounds that reminded him of the older days of drum & bass, speed garage and two-step, the main influences of his from years past. Levi runs A&R at Iron Shirt Recordings is currently signed to these labels : Iron Shirt Recordings, Vinyl Vigilance, Southside Dubstars UK and Really Good Recordings.",

        "personal_statement": "My passion in life is the journey of the healer. I believe that through looking into oneself, becoming honest, we can get back to our truest nature. The passions we had as a child, playing outside in the dirt, having fun with friends, loving animals and all creatures. Being curious and excited for life. The way we can get back to this essence of ourselves, is through sitting with our selves to really listen to our bodies sensibility: the foundation of our being. I believe that through healing ourselves and our community we can see more healthy, positive changes in the world. As within as without. I know that Impact shares a similar vision of having the courage to hold each other and make a difference in the world for the better.",

        "personal_statement": "I hold an unwavering belief that changes in perception occur when we engage our knowledge, beliefs, and experiences alongside the wisdom of a compassionate heart.  Evolving our human awareness to identify, understand, and transform our beliefs allows us to experience the  full potential of our essence.  \r\n\r\nI am the co-founder of SEE Uniqueness, a Director of Women Talk,  International Speaker & Author, and I have a passion to facilitate conversations of celebration and connection through varying formats.   As an Intuitive Connection Strategist and Catalyst for Inclusion Consciousness, I  facilitate programs, conversations, and opportunities that build interactions with impact.   I work with leaders and messengers ensuring they are equipped to create powerful and caring connections for individuals, families, and communities.  \r\n\r\n Along with my daughter Sydney, who is an award winning young woman with Down Syndrome, we started the 'Sydney's Million' movement inviting 1 Million people to celebrate and share their Uniqueness.  We are creating a new language in which to be curious,  SEE Uniqueness and Celebrate each other.   Curiosity creates connection, connection builds community, and community enhances our world! \r\n\r\nStaying in the conversation of celebrating uniqueness is even more important during this time of global transformation.  Over the past few months more then 6000 viewers have been impacted in our series of over 40 SEE Uniqueness Celebrates You FB Live events and the launch of our Conscious Conversations show.  \r\n\r\nI have witnessed the  impact of a soul recognizing and celebrating their uniqueness.  Wether it happens instantly or over time,  it always creates a ripple that changes families, and the world around us.    The Impact Festival is creating a ripple that will affect the conscious awareness of our world.    SEEing Uniqueness in oneself and those around us will enhance that impact and magnify what is already being experienced in the energy you have created.",

These are then reinforced with key number 3) Mindset: rewiring the brain by incorporating the knowledge that we have acquired with 'Meditation' (water rising, body part or energy centre meditations). This will help us break the habit of being our selves (Dr dispenza) :) in order to become the desirable ideal self! These workshops are powerful, transformational and fun! #letsmog",

No one is on their own, regardless of there struggles! So its about community, building new relationships, its about taking responsibility of our selves, of our lives, of our struggles  and to resonate that power that we all have inside of us, which is LOVE and COMPASSION!

I have utilized my passion for Indian classical and Bollywood dancing by performing in local fundraisers  (KCR, Inn from the Cold, East Meets West, JoeAnne's House to name a few). I have also cultivated the interest of young local girls by teaching them this dance form and igniting their interest in a different cultures. I also got the opportunity to showcase my talent in Kasugai- Kelowna's sister city, during my visit as Miss Kelowna. I am proud that I have been able to channelize my passion in a positive way that has brought about a change in the lives of people. With the opportunity at Impact festival, I hope I can further expand my platform and make an \"impact\" on people's lives.",

I want to bring joy to others and I do it best under a black light teaching how to create galactic space. I offer 2 primary messages during the paint class.\r\n1.\tHow to access consciousness through trusting your inner guidance by feeling color\r\n*The students are taught several ways to connect with there painting manifesting cosmic space appearing in front of them. \r\n\r\n2.\tHow to work through self limitations manifesting into personal transformation\r\n*We teach our students how to shift self criticisms into empowering opportunities. We offer new ways of looking at the same two sides of a coin. We encourage positive frequency’s, upliftment including playing in wonderment and how to stay outside of the box.",

Patterned thoughts are like computer programs that our minds cycle through routinely, which then generate a set of patterned attitudes and behaviors.\r\n\r\nWe can uninstall the programs that are harmful and preventing us from creating better lives. We can also install new programs to override the faulty thinking and behavioral patterns so that together, we can create a more peaceful world.\r\n\r\nYour most important relationship is the one you have with yourself - and there's a science to it called Attachment Styles.\r\n\r\nWhat you unconsciously believe to be true about yourself is also based on science, and it drives all your behaviors. With the knowledge of Attachment Styles, you have the opportunity to transform yourself, your relationships, and your community.",

        "vendor_name": "No bird has polluted the sky, nor any fish polluted the ocean.\r\n\r\nAnimals have always live in harmony, but we humans have threatened our own habitat with greed and ego. Through the wisdom of the indigenous people and the animal kingdom, we might be able to restore how to live in harmony with the planet, and bring balance back into the world. In this day in age, it is crucial for the world to hear this message before our destruction has reached a disastrous threshold.\r\n\r\nKashi is a self-taught visionary artist from Victoria, British Columbia. Her active creativity sprung up at an early age, constantly fueling her passion through drawing, painting and sculpting to bring her visions to life.\r\nAs a child, she deeply felt her calling in amplifying the voices of the animal kingdom. Now, she walks along side and calls in the spirits of the animals to assist her in her paintings, allowing them to tell their story through her and embed their essence into the canvas to reach the hearts and soul of others. Her ultimate goal and devotion is to assist the evolution of consciousness, and activate beholders into higher states of awareness.\r\n\r\nKashi's paintings advocate the voices and stories told by the indigenous people all over the world, including the messages and wisdom of the animal medicine. By having them lead and guide us forward towards the paths of our ancestral roots and traditions, they teach us how to be in harmony within ourselves, and in Oneness with the planet. We can achieve this by caring for all inhabitants and remaining connected to our sacred and only planet we call home, Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nHer artistic gift to the world is mysterious and influential, as she also embeds intention, prayer and awareness into every brushstroke to spark inspiration in others and assist the birthing of the new age of man. This modality is expressed to awaken the creative light within, and create a positive impact within the hearts of all.",
