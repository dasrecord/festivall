Will be touring Ireland Early January 2024 and Set to release his second major EP title ‚Äú H E R E NOW ‚Äúon March 1st, 2024. 

Renowned for his significant influence within the Irish Black community, he remains dedicated to paving the way for a brighter tomorrow.

Known for his success as an influential Brand and award-winning (Virgin Media Gold Award)  and his recently collaboration with Hugo Boss new fragrance bottle 

Dublin-based producer and musician, Chris Kabs has been hotly predicted to become one of Ireland's most promising breakthrough artists in the near future and has been named as Ireland‚Äôs Top Artists to watch for 2023 (Irish Examiner). 

The EP explores Kabs' ability to fuse genres together creating a mix between modern afro-beats, RnB, and pop mainstream music that has led him to be one of the most played Black Irish male artists across Irish radio so far in 2023 reaching over 3 million listeners across Irish radio (playlisted on RTE2fm and BBC), and hailed one of the 'Top Artists of the Year to Watch' across various media platforms. 

Having gained credibility and recognition across the live circuit performing on shows like Hard Working Class Heroes, Longitude, the legendary Dublin venue Whelans, RTE Live, SoundHouse, the Grand Social, and Cyprus Avenue - his energetic and vibrant live show has been called an almost spiritual experience.

""I was working with the late great Coolio last year on the legend's upcoming new musical project, which was such an honour, but sadly due to an untimely end to the project, it couldn't be finished. I sat with the words of Coolio ""gather up your pity and turn it into ambition', so I refocused my attention on this new EP and have just completed recording it.
