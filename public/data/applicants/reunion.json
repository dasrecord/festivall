An insatiable need to satisfy this hunger for new music aided in amassing a diverse collection of jungle, hip hop, soul, dancehall, dub and beyond. Djing and production was a natural progression to share his style and eclectic musical tastes.\nHis unique sets blend his excitement for his carefully selected fresh tracks with the vibe of the moment and vary from smooth and soulful to dark and moody. This style fits well for early morning to late night and everywhere in between. - \nWritten by Shylo Love at LoveFire Radio.\n\nwww.lovefire.ca/radio/\nwww.lovefire.ca/radio/mister-crowley/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hey_mr_crowley",

We start slow, forming a connection to our inner guidance and intention, building energy song after song, until we’re sweating/celebrating/laughing/liberating.  Maybe it looks like dancing, maybe it doesn’t.  Let your body tell the story of your energy.  The 90 minutes closes out gently with a time for cooling down, grounding, integrating the experience, and circling up to acknowledge those we have journeyed with.  This practice is a meditation in movement, an honoring of emotion, a celebration of life, and a beautiful way to build connection in community.",

His involvement in the Saskatchewan rave scene in the 90's and 2000's influenced his love of music and dance. Tripping out to George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars at Lollapoloza in 1994 set him on a path of discoverying funk, jazz, and disco and shortly after he financed his first turntables and mixer and the vinyl vault began to grow considerably.\n\nCuemulus is making his return to Festivall to play his second Sunday vinyl set and set the record straight that he is a deejay with a unique palette and style.",

His selection illustrates a mural of dark and smooth, deep and melodic, dynamic and jazzy, styled and swanky, all blended together by the fluid bass of rolling DnB and glued tight with goopy halftime. His bassy creations, curated for the weird and wonderful, for friends with fins or with feet, aim to serenade with soulful storytelling, journeying through explorations of the unconventional. \n\nWhether you’re down to hang around or lost and looking to be found, if you’re ready to soak it all in in Smokey’s Swanky Tank or have a hankering for some lopsided lounging closer to the ground. blackm0or welcomes all cool souls and spicy spirits to come flock around the fish pond, even for just a moment to let loose, become unbound, get weird, and listen to his sound.",

After amassing a sizeable music library, he bought his first DJ mixer in 1991 and started experimenting with mixing and scratching with an array of make-shift equipment and remnants from his mother’s record collection. October of 1994 marked his first public appearance as a DJ and he hasn’t looked back since. From his humble start doing small funk parties in his hometown Regina, to his hosting duties at the legendary Lydia’s  “Souled Out”(one of Canada’s longest running electronic music weeklies) he was able to make a name for himself as a respected DJ across North America. Dr.J currently holds numerous DJ residencies in Saskatoon, hosts the long running “Expansions” radio show, and is a contributing music writer for Hot Stuff magazine in the Netherlands. One word sums up Dr.J – F.U.N.K.",

        "why": "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.",
