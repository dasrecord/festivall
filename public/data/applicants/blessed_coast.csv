Our names are Rachelle and Ken and we are an all original, healing electronic music and live vocals based duo :) Our music is unique  in that we embed our creations with healing tones and sacred frequencies, tuned to 432 hz and laced with live, female, conscious vocals manifest with soul awakening poetry rapping and singing. Our message is about the Spirit's journey in the joyous human condition and the  experiences we face as we travel on this Earth as a collective awakening. :)

In additon to our music partnership, we are also in sacred union with eachother so the music creations that come through us are represented by the divine masculine and feminine within BOTH of us coming together in the tangible (or perhaps intangible :P) form of music and for that we feel extremely thankful to represent :)

Our calling is to allow our music to be vessels of love, joy, healing, dance and communication in language for each listener, dancer and Being whose path it may cross or transmute and we hope it may resonate within Blessed Coast's frequency as well :) 

PS - We are both energy healers and Rachelle is also a Pranic Energy Healing Instructor and Meditation Facilitator and would love to offer a workshop on any of her passions in those areas if permitted at Blessed Coast :) A powerful workshop of hers close to her heart is a healing circle through the form of spoken or written word or poetry as well which would be an honor to share with the guests of Blessed Coast :)

We thank you all so much again for this amazing and immense opportunity to share with other like minded and spirited individuals! Your great efforts in the movement of a loving gathering and divine community is absolutely appreciated by us! ðŸ™ In gratitude! :) We send loving blessings and abundance for all that you need!âœ¨

1. Interactive live painting
and/or
2. Exhibit my paintings

I love sharing the joy of painting!

1. For me painting is like dancing so I love to paint in festivals and parties. The energy of the music, the dancers is so driving and inspiring.

I like to install my easel around the dance floor and invite people to paint. It is often their first contact with the playfulness of oil paints. For some it is a beautiful discovery. For others it is a deep exploration of themselves.   Sometimes, experimented painters come to put their touch! I smoothly direct the activity so the people can learn and have fun at the same time.

It is an always renewed discovery of how the music, the brush, your body and soul come to dance with the paint.

Since I've been running this setup for while now I've acquired a lot of ''painting in parties'' experience. The setup may run on the partyâ€™s electrical setup or can be run on batteries. It is sturdy and it is not messy. The whole setup is quite adaptable.


2. I would also like to exhibit my paintings at the festival.  I begin a lot of paintings in festivals and conscious event during my Interactive Live Paintings activities.  When I come home I continue them in my workshop.  It seems good to me to bring them back in festival so I can share them with other nice people!

Photos of my paintings and photos of the Interactive Live Paintings are on my website.

Have a beautiful festival preparation my friends! 
",https://www.simonprovost.com,,One or two tickets.  After that it would be nice if you could put some money for painting material.

I am applying on behalf of Ginger & Moonshine. We played at One Love in 2013 and Blessed Coast in 2015. We love this festival! Here is our bio:

Formed in 2009, Ginger & Moonshine started with a few friends jamming on a sailboat one night anchored off Gabriola Island. When they got the whole pub up on their feet later that night at the open mic, starting a band just felt right. The girls started playing the Vancouver circuit with original reggae, folk and country tunes. Known for infectious grooves, super-good vibes and great jams, G&M quickly grew to become a powerful mix of 7 talented ladies and 1 bad-ass dude rockinâ€™ some of the sweetest, most intimate venues in Vancouver. Each Ginger & Moonshine member writes their own music, stretching the bandâ€™s range to encompass everything from dub and reggae to salsa, jazz, blues, rock/pop and folk. Rich 4-part harmonies, violin, trumpet and keys give G&Mâ€™s music a beautiful, unified sound that transcends genres and makes you feel good.",We have almost finished mixing our album!

What I am offering is a one of a kind, unique performance merging live beatboxing with a high energy electronic set composed largely of my original productions! 

Here is my artist biography; 

It's hard to believe the music blaring through the speakers is coming entirely from his mouth; with that rattling bass, layered in perfectly timed beats and dimensional sounds. The melody is there, you get lost in the beat, and just fall along with the drop. Beatboxing at it's finest. After all, you are only listening to British Columbia's top beatboxer, and one of Canada's top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships. It's the perfect intro for the set he's about to mix; a variety of tunes, including many of his own productions, sure to keep any crowd swimming hard through those sound waves all through the night. Chrizpy Chriz is a show you simply cannot miss; stage presence, personality and, of course, talent all up on one stage. He is well known through the interior of British Columbia having placed a lasting impression on the many crowds he's provided with the gift of his sound art. You might have caught him rocking his decks at underground shows and festivals, including, but not limited to, Burning Man (NV, USA), Elysium (the Blue), Felurian Grove, Kicking Up Dirt, IUG Jamboree, Get Bananas, U4eeyah, and a spontaneous in-between performance at Envision (Costa Rica), opening for artists such as Snak the Ripper, Mark Instinct, Terravita, Mat the Alien, Meikulator (Perkulat0r and Alex Mei), Ill-esha, and Pigeon Hole. Headlining Cascadia NW (WA, USA) as part of the Future Perfect Events showcase, he shared the main stage with artists such as  Penny Wide Pupils, Kozmo, Willdabeast, Bleep Bloop, and Tipper. He's also played shows in California and Washington, pulling in crowds , and performed right alongside the well known Micheal Winslow. His YouTube reputation is also not a disappointment, with an ever-growing following of over 1100 subscribers, over 300,000 views, and holding a partnership with Fullscreen inc. Chrizpy Chriz is a performance you won't regret bringing to your stage or event. Prepare yourself for a show you won't forget. 

At events and festivals, Chrizpy Chriz offers beatboxing workshops. Suitable for all levels, learn the basics of beatboxing as well as more advanced techniques and sounds. You'll also get to appreciate a short performance and there is always plenty of space to get any questions you may have answered.

Artist Statement;

""I have fully immersed myself in the crazy world that is electronic music and the scene that come with it. Absolutely passionate about what I do, I have taken on music full time and am pouring myself into the ultimate creation of sound. I strive to create a positive vibe and keep a crowd dancing to an ever changing combination of beats and sound waves. One of my goals as an artist is to help merge the line between the electronic and the organic creation of sound.

I would just like to add a huge thank you for taking the time to review my application and take me into consideration for Blessed Coast 2016, I would be stoked for the opportunity to participate in this lovely event! I look forward to hearing back!

The journey began with playing the guitar, drums, bass, DJembe and from classical rock and progressive rock to thrash metal. Eventually I realised that there is a global space in which people dance and express themselves with lesser bias. Its about collective catharsis and freedom. I was partly raised in Goa, India, which is the hub for a counterculture. I believe that at the end of the day, the underground is all one.

Press Clippings:
""Kyler Schogen played soulful music for the crowds attending..."" 
- Ian Kucerak, Edmonton Sun (Oct 09, 2011)

""(CD Review of ""Pocket Fulla Nothin'"", SunCave Records - May 1/2011.) Kyler Schogen hits a 
sweet spot musically, that area just where rock, blues and folk converge. It is a place which 
musically, is almost ideal, at least to my ears, a devout blues lover, who appreciates a good rock 
song, and the lyrical strength of folk. It's a crossover locale others have visited, some making it their musical home. Schogen should certainly make it his residence since he is clearly at home in this neighbourhood. The end result is a pleasing CD, an effort worth lending an ear to, just maybe regularly."" 
- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Jul 27, 2011) 

""Kyler Schogen headlined the evening, (Springtime in Alberta Festival, Hayloft Acres). The band played an original set and captivated the crowd with thought provoking lyrics and hooky melodies from their new CD, ""Pocket Fulla Nothin'"". They rose above an evening chorus of mosquitoes and frogs to wow an appreciative audience. ""
- Karen Pedlar, Smoky Lake Signal (May 25, 2011) 

""(Review of ""Electric Life"" - Kyler Schogen, SunCave Records. Released March 1/ 2009.) Schogen is actually a veteran blues man, having recorded several CDs since the mid-1990s with his own band. The music is that sort of good-timing blues which gets the toes tapping. The music has the sad side of life lyrics, but the music suggests tossing the negativity and having some fun. Schogen does a good job of offering up that take on things. A fun blues CD disk for a summer drive.""                
- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Sep 01, 2010) 

""Starlight Dreams is a well-composed collection of songs that will certainly take the listener on a journey as it fuses a bluesy approach with Spanish and Latin sounding melodies.

As for my performing experiences in BC and mostly Vancouver: I have played shows at cafe deux soleils, at the Calabash, at Ten Ten Tapas, at Pancake and Jam, at the Backstage lounge and at the Charqui Grill. 
I am also a regular of the open mic scene and play every week either at Simply delicious on Main Street, Romer's burger Bar or at the King's head.

My stage name is Ch'tite fille which is the french for Lil' Girl. I sing my own songs in French and English and also a wide repertoire of covers (100 songs) from my favorite artistes: Tracy Chapman, Ben Harper, Eva Cassidy, Boy, You + Me, Jeff Buckley, Georges Brassens, Camille, Saez, Edith Piaf.. to name a few.
My type of music (acoustic folk/pop/blues/rock) is pretty smooth and moody with a minimalist setting : my (said-to-be) aerial emotion-charged vocals and my guitar and/or ukulele mostly finger-picked melodies. I sing raw feelings from a place of deep sensitivity and vulnerability with the dream of touching and opening hearts (ambitious I know ;)).

You'll find my most recent recordings on Reverbnation and on my website: https://www.reverbnation.com/chtitefille

4/26/2017 16:26:17,Ravensdaughter,bravensdaughter@gmail.com,Musician,"I am a local up an coming artist with a big heart and vision. 

I spent five years in Squamish where I studied at Quest University Canada and recorded my debut album as my graduating thesis project. 
I have a loving community for followers in squamish and Vancouver, and it would be a great pleasure to come back to Squamsh this summer to share new and old songs!

You can listen my album here: https://ravensdaughter.bandcamp.com/releases

I use music to grow my own self awareness, inspire crtical self-reflection in others, and build intentional community. 
 Musical composition is a tool for bringing implicit cognition into conscious awareness. It brings up insecurities, values, expectations, conditioning, suppressed emotions, memories etc. Many tools work similarly, but, as a musician, songwriting and music production are my preferred methods. My album is a manifestation of my inner process and the drop of inspiration that I hope will ripple from my inner being, out through my music, into my behaviour, through my interactions and out into my community. 

The profound influence parents have on their children during their cognitive development has illuminated my understanding of how we influence everyone around us and how we are constantly shaped by our relationships and social interactions. As a privileged, educated, young woman I feel a personal responsibility to critically self-reflect and become conscious of the ways in which I interact with and influence others.
I am not a mother, but I am an artist, and I know that art”in my case music”has tremendous power to emotionally touch, inspire and affect others. It is a community builder and a powerful language. I use this language to communicate my truth, attract like-minded individuals, deeply and intimately connect with myself and others, and thereby build community.
I want to live in a healthy community with a healthy culture where individuals are free to be themselves, where people's experience and expression are validated and pursuing self-actualization feels safe and supported. I have set out to seed such a community through music: through creative collaboration and through personal as well as interpersonal shadow-work. By recording my music, which reflects my values and my vision, I am planting a seed for a collaborative community around me. I feel pregnant with a culture, and I am motherly committed to nurturing it and bringing it into this world.

My songs are inspired by my own experience and the core messages are often about truely looking at our values. I express my own values such as care for the environment, family, love and gratitude for all the mothers and lifegvers, and I sometimes make little social commentaries about the society we live in, yet all with a flowy, dancy feel. 

I play my live sets with a violinist, another gutar player and a beatboxer. The sound is simillar to the album but has a slightly folkyer vibe. 


Blessings,

Barbora Ravensdaughter

There are many testimonials, bio etc on my website.

The space I create is deep, powerful and reflective.

I enjoy some sharing time after most journeys, though sometimes a mandala creation or journaling is more appropriate. I begin by softly guide participants into their breath, as they lay on the ground, connecting deeply to the core of the earth. I  bring on the large frequencies of the bowls and then vowels and tones of voice. I use a beautiful, strong voice that brings people deep into their journey and holds just as strong of a loving, nurturing space for whatever comes up.

Three months after graduating high-school, the teen left home on a solo adventure to the other side of the world in pursuit of experiences and knowledge.

Living a secure and easy life under the wing of his parents was something Sam did not approve of. Perhaps it was the fact that he was born an only child, but his craving for independence led him to live a life against the grain of social norms. Instead of celebrating his 18th birthday with an extravagant party, he chose to run around signing forms and taking photos to finalise his passport. Or when faced with the task of paying rent, he went busking 6 hours a day, 7 days a week in subway stations instead of relying on an employer.

After travelling from east to west in Canada, Sam has found his home in Vancouver. The city's focus on social and mental consciousness has been swallowed in large gulps and transformed into inspiration for him to write many songs, namely so, 'Just Breathe'. A catalogue of other songs are also at a ready to record state. 

Due to his motivated demeanor and eagerness to shake every hand, Sam has been presented with many opportunities and received plenty of support from the good friends he has made in the local Vancouver music scene. Experiencing this camaraderie has taught him that accepting help is okay, as long as you are working hard enough to deserve it.

Okayplayer dubbed her a mix of Billie Holiday and Portishead, adding that sheâ€™s a ""dynamic singer with an obvious foundation in soulâ€. After leaving her first record-contract with The Hastings set due to creative differences, Sophia went back to school to enhance her skills as a producer and sound engineer so she could have more control over her creative process and further explore her artistry.  With a new found sense of empowerment as an independent artist, Sophia has created a new record in which the raw beauty of her voice takes centre stage. 

Her debut album, Love Royale, set to be released in February 2016, is an evocative collection of songs intended to take the listener on an introspective journey.  Sophia has spent the last two years honing her production skills, and collaborating with a variety of artists and producers such as Grammy award winning, Jon Brown (Meghan Trainor, Pink) and Vancouver's own, Matt Brevner. Inspired by Brown's LA studio, built inside one of Marilyn Monroe's early homes, Sophia's newly released single and music video, Daytime Dreaming, has an essence of old hollywood glamour. With its compelling arrangement of music and lyrics, Daytime Dreaming tells a story of longing for something more.

With the release of her first EP, Wishing Well, 2013 was a breakthrough year for Sophia. Wishing Well was produced by grammy award winner Chin Injeti, and featured Talib Kwali, Shad and DJ Khalil. Her song, ""Higher Baby"", was licensed to Appleton Rum for a nation wide advertising campaign, and she garnered two Juno nominations for her work with Madchild, and rising stars SonReal and Rich Kidd. Sophia, a dynamic performer, has shared the stage with Aloe Blacc, Quadron, and De La Soul. Other notable performances include last year's Manifesto Festival in Dundas Square Toronto, and the 102nd Grey Cup Festival in Vancouver.

Sophia, always evolving in her artistry, is a talent to watch for. Look out for her touring across Canada and the U.S. in support of Love Royale.

While jamming on the beach, singer/guitarists Zach Cornfield and Damon Hanly lamented the fact that there was nowhere in their city to go to listen to the old-school reggae hits they so enjoyed playing. After pondering on this for a brief moment, the obvious solution to this simple problem became apparent: start a reggae band! A couple of weeks later, the curly-haired duo did just that, and recruited bassist Leo Bell and drummer Mike Ramos to complete the lineup. After a successful outdoor gig at The Libra Room during Car Free Days on Commercial Drive, the band went on to secure a monthly gig at the local East Van music hotspot. The band has since played the Make Music Festival in Vancouver, and has also brought their irie vibes to shows in Squamish and Whistler. Reggaelution also recently played to their largest crowd yet at the Vancouver Art Gallery for the Cannabis Day rally. Playing everything from Desmond Dekker to Barrington Levy, Bob Marley to Jacob Miller, Burning Spear to Gregory Isaacs, the band focuses on bringing that laid back roots reggae sound to their live shows, which inevitably end up with people dancing on their feet, or at the very least, grooving in their seats.

Sub Theory is much more than a collection of beats; it is a musical project that reflects the culmination of almost a decadeâ€™s worth touring and performing. Laying his hands on production and live performance, Sub Theory brings together a potent mix of Bass dub, and ethnic fusion in to his sets.

To his ever-expanding fanbase, Sub Theory is much more than a DJ or producer; he is a master crafter of the collective experience, a shaman of spiritual escape found by following the beats. The journey continues; turning 34 this year, Sub Theory has only scratched the surface of himself as an artist and a person. Resonating on a deeper level, this is Sub Theoryâ€™s spirit shining through the haze, breaking through the foggy veil of singularity to find the human connection.",

By the time One Love comes around, I'll have integrated live bass guitar, electric guitar, and 2 sweet hardware synths into my show (actually I'll be whipping those out next week at Sequential Circus for the first time).

For the answer below btw, I would ESPECIALLY love to play One Love. I actually heard about it because Kala was at my set at Summer Intention a couple weeks ago - we talked after and he told me about this festival, and asked me if I'd be interested in playing (which I totally am, hence this application ;) )

Last but not least, here are 4 different sets I've played over the past 6 months (keep in mind these are all completely improvised in real time):

My most recent live set (played at Nautilus Deep End Music last week) - starts midtempo, shifts up into drum n bass by the end - https://soundcloud.com/thisissami/nautilus-july-3-2013

My favorite chilled out set I've played thus far (this was originally a volume level setting jam, but it turned into a full set when i loved what i played too much to stop): https://soundcloud.com/thisissami/setting_the_levels

AND SOME VIDEOS

This is an ElectroBlues set I played 6 months ago that showcases one of the ways that I make music (keep in mind this was only 3-4 months into the existence of my act - not as tight as I am now): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7joZ_DA3ljE

And last but not least, here is a downtempo set from January (2-3 months into my gig) where I use a different input method (keyboards) and I also freestyle! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zi9Nqr2Hv0

YAY! I hope you guys enjoy listening to the above :)",,Yes,,"I would absolutely LOVE to play numerous sets! for real!! I can do all kinds of styles - the only thing that stays consistent between my sets is that I loop it all live (and it's improvised). I would love to play a trippy downtempo set, a funky housey set, a live rock set, a dnb set, etc. 

I would also love to collaborate with other musicians there. I'd love to be able to lay down a beat and a bass groove, and then just rock out with some other peeps all on our own various instruments. If you guys have a drumset there too, that would be phenomenal (I've been playing the drums for 10+ years) - though I'd need to practice here in Vancouver first in order to integrate it into my live show. 

As far as requirements go, I don't really have any... Ideally you guys would be able to have an audio interface I could use for my set, since mine is super heavy and I don't have a vehicle... Transportation + a safe place to leave my gear actually might be a reuiqrement? Not sure - I'd have to figure out logistics. 

An awesome thing to have would be a video feed from the stage so that people watching can see what I'm doing (they can connect the sounds they hear directly to what I do with my various machines!). 

Anyway this is getting pretty long, so I'll end this application now. In case it isn't clear from here, I have a lot of energy and would love to be part of the entertainment for One Love. Sounds like a wicked festival.",

Depending on the time (and setup) I may be with another guitarist and possibly some percussion, but I would most likely perform just solo for this event.",,Yes,,"I would simply need a PA with a couple DI's available on stage, very simple.

For 20 years I have been spinning dub & Detroit roots techno and outerspace deep house... I work with vinyl, love & skill on two to three turntables, crafting deep journeys through layered sounds of underground rhythm. I'm inspired by cosmic and outerspace sounds that connect spirituality to science fiction... what is known as Afrofuturism... In dub the science fictional sound manifests through Lee Scratch Perry and Scientist... in dub techno, this comes together in 4/4 deep bass rhythms and shifting percussion in Basic Channel... I'm originally from Vancouver, where during the '90s I was director of the <ST> collective (http://shrumtribe.com). We collaborated with rave_era collectives HQ Communications, B-Side, and TeamLounge (whose members are still around today). Throughout the 2000s, I spent a decade in Montreal, playing festivals like MUTEK and Montreal Electronic Groove, as well as across North America, Europe, and elsewhere... Wherever I go, I keep to the underground, organising small events, collaborating with electronic and live musicians, and releasing on my experimental label IO SOUND [ http://iosound.ca ]. In 2008 I moved back out West to reorient myself to the forest and shifting glaciers. I bless nature everyday with movement and sound. Over the past few years I have played Believe Festival and Bass Coast as well as smaller Whistler gatherings organised by Miss Kosmik...

From David Suzuki's Blue Dot Tour at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver, to the Uplift Festival & Woodford Festival in Australia, I have humbly shared stages and panels with artists like Feist, The Barenaked Ladies, David Suzuki, Trevor Hall, Hey Ocean, Natalie Rize, Nahko Bear, and Neil Young, in the hopes of spreading a message of hope and action. 

I am proud to stay connected to where I call home, and I feel blessed to be a part of a musical community that includes sharing stages and collaborating with other lower-mainland Coast-Salish performers including Buckman Coe, Erin Sage & Warless, Emily Molloy, Will Ross, Leah Barley, and Sliammon Nation artist & activist Ta'Kaiya Blaney. Ta'Kaiya and I just completed a month-long speaking and music tour in Australia, and I look forward to more opportunities where I can make music & share the message of using our voice to speak up for the rights of the land and the people.

Making music with my sister, who travels with me as my only bandmate, is an especially magic experience - she mirrors me so intuitively. Her subtle & intelligent musicianship compliments my raw dynamic energy, and to do what you love with your family is an incredible gift that I adore sharing with the world. 

I'm currently on tour across Canada (hello from Thunder Bay, Ontario!). I thrive when performing in conscious spaces - the tour includes stops at yoga studios, prayer spaces, collective houses, and high schools. The last show will be in Vancouver on May 16th at Groundswell Grassroots Business Collective & Cafe.

As  a resident artist and a board member of 'The Jellyfish Project', an international coalition of musicians for the environment, I speak to artists and musicians about leveraging their power and influence as creatives towards creating environmental and social change. The project works to mobilize the music industry to speak up for the environmental realities of our time and empowers bands and artists to be part of the solution, in alignment with First Nations leadership and solidarity (take a look at thejellyfishproject.org).

A little about Will and the band:

A Southern Ontario transplant, Will Ross came to the West Coast with the experience of playing in the Hamilton Classic Rock jam band and Ska scene before deciding to take his ideas elsewhere, pursuing a new sound. Finding a beautiful place to live in Squamish, B.C Will quickly caught the eyes and ears of the Sea to Sky area and won both The Whistler Talent Search 2014 and the Squamish Reader's Choice top musician of 2014. Joining forces with some of the highest caliber musicians Squamish had to offer, he formed the Will Ross Band. They recorded their first full length record, Freeloader, which was released August 2014 and has been getting great reviews. A mix of many different genres, Will likes to refer to the sound as â€œacoustic funkified folk rock and roll.â€

",,Yes,,"My eight-year-old daughter's favourite joke at the moment is:

Why did the banana go to the doctor?
Because he wasn't peeling very well...

We would love to be a part of this festival. Performing our songs, some of which were written in response to our coastal environmental crisis, the refugee crisis internationally, and our human need to find ways to journey lighter on this earth and within ourselves, would be a magically fit for Blessed Coast.

Over the past two years we have been busy carving out a niche for ourselves in the west coast underground bass/house music scene as one of the only male-female/couple DJ/Production duo's around. Known for our undeniably contagious, high energy sets, teamwork on the decks, and deep wobbly rolling basslines; we have gained a large following and an expectation to always deliver a top notch performance. With over 70 shows and 8 music festivals in the past year alone, we are starting to capture the attention of a global audience. We've have played several shows in the Southern California region and toured in the US, Spain and Mexico.

Not only do we spend countless hours refining our mixing skills, but we also produce our own tracks. With an ear for the music, the transition into production was natural. We have already released 6 original tracks and 2 remixes in our first year of producing, 3 of which were signed to record labels (MalLabel Music, Helitricity Records, Sheppard Records).  Our first Beatport release in January 2017, 'Hot Boi' charted in the Top 100 Indie Dance/Nu Disco Releases, reaching spot #4. We are currently producing our first album :) 

Our music can be described as bouncy, 4 to the floor beats, characterized by pretty melodies and deep, wobbly, rolling basslines; heavily influenced by hip hop and the underground bass house music scene. The love and passion we have for our craft and for each other is undeniable and transcends everything we do! Specializing in Wobble House, G House, Tech House, and Brazilian Bass.

I've been DJing as a sideline since the mid 90s.  I have a varied and eclectic taste in music colored by my experiences and the cities I've lived in over the years - Toronto, Melbourne, Berlin, and now Victoria (my current home).  I like to share with the listener or dancer something they might not have heard before, or put something in a new context.   I like to play multi-genre sets that take people on a journey.  Deep, hypnotic, warm and soulful are vibes I like to share.  I prefer daytime/evening/warm-up time-slots.

My sounds usually involve dub/reggae/world/jazz often crossed with house, techno, bass, and ambient/chill.   At the moment I'm really into the digital/bass folklore sounds of (or inspired by) South America.

My DJ name is Soulsystem.

My friend Pyrrha (Sarah) Luna recommended I apply to your event :)

Ever since attending and volunteering at Blessed Coast last year I've wanted to play a set there.  So I just did a little mix inspired by the thought of playing at this year's event.  I was actually imagining the set in the late morning or early afternoon before the regular programing begins.   (If I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember the music only starting in the afternoon at some point..?).   Anyway, I'll leave that up to you ;-)  The mix is called Innaspace (ie.

I just found out about this festival a few days ago which is surprising seeing how just last week I was researching One Love festivals globally and found many in other countries not realizing what you were doing right here at home. How awesome.

I am a yoga teacher and in 2011 I founded the Church of Reggae Yoga, and have been hosting reggae yoga at festivals and studios around BC since (https://www.facebook.com/ChurchofReggaeYoga). 

This year myself and my partner DJ CaÃ§adora (https://soundcloud.com/cacadora) are doing a summer tour and teaching reggae yoga at Luminosity Festival, Bass Coast Festival and Shambhala this summer.  We would love to come and do a session at One Love Festival.  The vision of this festival is so inspiring and aligned with what we want to bring and be a part of.   

Melissa (DJ CaÃ§adora) and I are also reggae DJ's who play reggae at the Reef here in Victoria and another way we could contribute is by playing a DJ set either together or separately.  My DJ name is Monkey Tree (http://www.mixcloud.com/Monkey_Tree/).

I look forward to connecting.

One Love,

Tracking earthly frequencies for sensual sounds.

Her sets lean towards the organic, blending world roots rhythms with tasty electronic beats. She incorporates a healthy dub influence in her sound, spun with Jamaican, East Indian, Latin, Brazilian and funk flavours. CaÃ§adora delivers these global vibrations with a sweet warm bass and serves them up inside dub, reggae, glitch hop, dancehall and breakbeat -- subwoofer is a must.

Her collage of lyrical rap flow and smooth vocal melodies over criss-crossing genres has earned her a loyal tribe and expanding fan base. Lozen exudes an energy that is both raw and authentic. Live shows have evolved her unique approach to Hip Hop while recordings have pushed her sound across the globe.

Lozen's success sparked when she teamed up with Bombastic Jam Label boss and funk producer Basement Freaks (Hamburg, Germany). Bootyfunk (2011) garnered a significant amount of online press, reaching No#3 on junodownload.com and racked up hundreds of thousands of plays on
soundcloud.com with the overwhelming public response received from the ""Records in the Crate"" single remix competition. Lozen was able to keep the momentum going with Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON) releasing Tragedy & Triumph Mixtape (2012) which ranked No#10 on the National Hip Hop Charts.

After opening for roster of heavyweights including De La Soul, Blackalicious, The Beatnuts, Masta Ace and Swollen Members it was time to hit the road. Touring with Kyprios and Animal Nation fueled the fire and the next collaborative project was born. Shake It Up (2014) was produced by Animal Nation and released via Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON), reaching No#6 on the National Hip Hop Charts and No#37 on CMJ USA Top 40 Hip Hop.

With a number of successful releases under her belt, headhunters have begun noticing Lozenâ€™s refreshingly dynamic style. After spending several years refining her craft, this self-professed lyrical warrior has undoubtedly matured into an innovative new-school leader. Performing at world-renowned festivals; Envision 2015 (Uvita, Costa Rica), Shambhala Music Festival 2013 & 2010 (Nelson, BC) Lozen is quickly becoming a household name. Now achieving notable emcee status, add DJ and guitarist to the mix. Lozen's on the fly off the cuff spirit shines through when performing on stage. She has a way of connecting with her audience by bringing people together. The credo: Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.

One of the reasons you canâ€™t take your eyes off her is your ears. Soulful, yet gritty. Lighthearted, yet deep. Her work ethic and passion has earned her residency at nightclubs and radio shows, reaffirming why she remains a buzzworthy artist who grabs your attention.

My name is Chelsea, and I manage and book shows for my good friends, who are in a band called The Poolsharks. Basically they've been playing music since we were all in high school, but as life goes, it had not been the priority against surviving as young people since then. Although from the very beginning, I actually loved their originals, and really believed in them going somewhere.

About 4 months ago, I was tired of seeing them not doing anything with their fun and awesome music, so I offered to step in with some organization and pushing skills. Since then they've started practicing more seriously and playing some bigger gigs with great turn outs and actually making a bit of cash for doing what they love! This is the greatest part :D

So now we're trying to get them into some festivals to be a part of the collective!",https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9PiS-yvfM2Fem9aUHFWOFp4MDg,Yes,will play for beer :),"From Vancouver, they're a 3 piece indie/pop/punk/dance rock band called The Poolsharks.

I was just wanting to inquire if you had started accepting applications for 2018's Blessed Coast Festival

A bit about myself: My name is Tyler Bartfai, I am a singer-songwriter from Powell River, B.C. Stylistically I play across a variety of genres, from roots, blues, pop, to folk. My songwriting approach has always been emotional expression, to elicit a strong connection to an audience.  Currently I am in the infancy of beginning to record an album that will be available in Spring.

Depending on the needs of your festival, I could play anywhere from solo to a three piece band.

More information on myself and my music can be found at www.tylerbartfaimusic.com

Thank you very much for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.

All the Best,

Amble Greene is led by Cameron Gray and is considered a pseudonym for his solo project.

There's a certain spin of english about the name, which only adds to truth, most of his music is inspired by British 60's, and 70's pop/rock/folk acts.

Amble Greene was selected in Vancouver's Peak Performance Project top 20 in 2013. Cam is currently living in his van which he has converted into a make-shift recording studio, and has been actively supporting the decentralization movement in Vancouver.

He jokingly refers to himself as ""solarpunk for having futuristic gadgets, solar panels, wires and knobs housed in the shell of his 1981 V8 chevy funcraft. Believing music should transcend meaning into other mediums of communication, he is inspired by philosophy, technology, community, and sustainability, believing they're all integrated in one system.

Amble Greene tries to tweak the traditional model of what's expected of an act. Sure there's showmanship, entertainment, but there's also innovation, forward thinking and most importantly an intimate connection.

Cam has also begun construction on a tiny house that he's building on a trailer. One day he hopes to live in this house and be able to record his own music at will. Ideally he would like to live sustainably, grow his own food and continue to explore this infinite world and its endless mysteries. 

His end goal as an artist would be to inspire people to live differently and to become more conscious of the socio-economic problems that face our uncertain future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmN50lyQUi4,,$150,"I usually play with well produced backing tracks for a band. A lot of the songs are drastically different from each other so it creates a cool ""different world effect"" with each song. 

I haven't played in awhile because I have been busy in the decentralization scene, but I'm ready to start playing again. :)

I ignite an understanding of truth and individual awakening through the profound blossoming of creativity in the hopes that it becomes contagious. This is why I paint live. My painting process is rhythmical, meditative and highly focused. As I capture the mood of the event, viewers see the transformation and they immediately understand and respect this hand-crafted approach which leads to self-reflection and raises the question of ˜Where, in my life, could I find the same relaxed flow?' ˜If I slowed down, and had enough time¦ what could I do?' painting performances expand the artistic communication bandwidth beyond the finished image.",https://www.scarletart.ca/,,0,All that's required is the space for my easel.

4/14/2017 15:14:44,Devin and Forbidden,Khadija.jaii@hotmail.com,Artist,"I am performing live painting, not on canvas, but rather on a person, a Devin nude body, and using henna as my medium - natural body art (temporary tattoos). 

This live painting installation would start at sunrise near a music stage and end at sunset (to mimic the time of fasting for Muslims during the sacred month of Ramadan). I would cover the Devin body with traditional Arabic henna motifs prominent in Muslim culture and used for religious holidays and sacred unions such as weddings. And when the henna has dried and crumbled off, the skin will be stained with the motifs and will remain stained for several days.   

The concept of this live body painting installation is to intentionally juxtapose the two worlds that I come from - My Moroccan heritage, an Arabic culture which relies heavily on its conservative religious customs, and my French Canadian heritage - a very liberal, open-minded and free spirited realm. My questions in this installation are - What is sacred? What is forbidden? And why? What is the meaning of sacred? Where are the limits of beauty, divinity and blasphemy? And so I draw from these questions as I make my own lines from my heritage on a Devin nude body for all to see. 

I see divinity as a presence that is always there, and is either blocked and hidden or shining and flowing on to share and touch others. In this installation, the concept of staining skin for several days gives life and longevity to the art, as it will remain a shine and persist when I, the artist, has stopped ""painting. Its is a moving installation, living, breathing, dancing, and ever changing, as the tint will fade after several days, and as the Devin body tans, sweats or freckles from the sun. 

This is an original instillation, so I don't have a website showcasing my work, but I have attached my Pinterest page where I draw my inspiration of henna designs. ",https://www.pinterest.com/khokha92/body-art/,,$80 - for cost of henna (and body work for doing henna all day :P),"I only require daytime use of the stage and possibly a shaded or covered area to protect from sun or rain.

I am a visual artist and hoop performer and have a few things I would be interested in offering and bringing to this year's event! 


Live Painting;
I bring all my own set up and work on a painting during the festival, I would just need some power for lighting my work in the evening. 


Art Installation;
This one is best explained through my website, I'll link you to the page for this year's piece. It will already be at Astral Harvest and Revelation this year, and still confirming details with Zion Noiz and What The Festival but it should be making rounds there too!

http://www.luna-artanddesign.com/spirit-guides.html


Art Exposition;
I would love to bring in my 2D work to expose, some of it is blacklight reactive, and I have prints, leggings and scarves that I would like to vend on which I would be open to working out a commission rate.


Hoop Performances;
I can perform during DJ sets, I have an LED smart hoop for night-time performances. I have previously performed at Shambhala, Cascadia NW, and Elysium, and have Astral Harvest confirmed for this year as well. 


Also open to potentially teaching hula hoop workshops!

Artist Biography;
Luna was barely five when her parents conveyed the concept of a ""job"" to her, and right then and there the answer already was ""an artist!"" Not many can say they've fulfilled their childhood dreams. In high school, she took art IB, did a two year pre-university program in visual arts and completed up to her second year at Emily Carr University before realizing that school wasn't for her. It was at this point in time that she set off on a journey with no other purpose than to experience, and it was then that she met her greatest of teachers, Mother Earth herself. Constantly inspired by the frantic, changing world by which she surrounds herself, Luna is always striving to create in new ways, new mediums, to share ideas and expand thoughts. To make you analyze the very fabric of life from another perspective.


Thank you so much for taking my creations into consideration for exposition at Blessed Coast! I would just like to add that my boyfriend has also applied to perform as a musician (Chrizpy Chriz/Chris Gouchie) which means that I would not require any travel coverage if he were to make it in as well (and, since I know you are small budget, I would actually be completely open to doing it only for sale profits on my artwork, since if he is in, I would be there either way!). I look forward to hearing back!

Much Love,
Luna ",https://luna-artanddesign.com,Yes,LOVE ,"My art installation requires two standard power outlets for each skull to power the blacklights and LED's at night, and for live-painting I require two power outlets for lighting. ",

2/20/2017 17:01:01,Steven Sedalia,stevensedaliamusic@gmail.com,,"""Steven Sedalia is a singer-songwriter forging a sunkissed folk fusion sound with carefully constructed stories and symbolism seemingly carved by the river itself, using organic acoustic instruments, along with earth-tone percussion and a bright mantric vocal style, his conscious messages emphasize themes of Love, wonder, and connection to the Great Mother Earth. Being raised in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, and living in his current home base on the isle of Kauaâ€™i, in the Hawaiian island chain, the beauty of nature is ever present in the songs, providing a template for stories of adventure, growing pains, and deep reverence for the Land. In the music is the story of all lives, an honest grounding and a ruthless determination to transcend. Sedalia infuses with his live performance, a firm and compassionate call for environmental justice action and support, and creates a dynamic, interactive conversation through crowd involvement in the performance. Playing alongside artists such as Nahko & Medicine for the People, Xavier Rudd, and Tubby Love, Sedalia's music helps to push along the greater conscious music movement. Layered with ancient symbolism created by close contact with the flesh of the earth, along with the cultivation of the travelerâ€™s wide eyes, the songs share the gift of unflinching compassion.""

""In addition to being touring musicians, Sedalia and friends are organic farmers in Hawaii. Infused in the music is their love for the land and a call for a healthy relationship with the land through directly inspiring listeners into a feeling of reverence for nature.

4/10/2017 18:41:31,SoundSeed Medicine Journeys,Ocian@ociansound.com,," I am purposing space to set up a temporary labyrinth for the whole weekend for people to walk, clear, set intentions or the like. I will make a welcome sign at the entrance to help people get to know this 4,000 year old practice that is found around the world in many different rituals and religions. The labyrinth will be set up and open all weekend (lines created with fabric layed out, maybe small stones, contained candles at night etc.) which I am willing to steward, monitor and maintain. I am also called to offer one/two time slots where the bowls will be set up and people can sit with me (in small group or one-on-one) before they walk to explore the different ways to Find deep purpose or intention in this dynamic meditation. This will be by signup or walk in (which ever suites the space/time best). When people are ready to enter the labyrinth with their new found intention and way of walking, I will play the Crystal Choir (crystal bowls, lyre, chimes etc) to allow for deep openings through the SoundSeed Medicine as they walk to centre and back out again. 
Either an installation for the entire weekend if we find an appropriate space, or at the main stage at sunset one night and i will create it for the use of 1.5/2hrs with candles, fabrics and offer a short description and play and invite people to walk for the duration of that time then take it down again. 

Description: This mystical ritual, thousands of years old, is a metaphor or one's journey to the centre of understanding. The Labyrith is a sacred space, like the medicine wheel, and a universal symbol of peace. It is a pattern with purpose, an ancient tool that speaks to a long forgotten part of us. Lying dormant for centuries, labyrinths are undergoing a revival for use and interest. They offer a chance to take 'time out' from our busy lives, to leave schedules and stress behind. Walking its path is a gift we give to ourselves, leading to discovery, insight, peacefulness, happiness and sometimes tears, connectedness, and well being. 
The Labyrith will be set up and open to walk any time all weekend, with ceremonial opening (friday time) and official closing (Sunday evening time). Please join for these specific times as well. There will be opportunity on (Saturday/sunday morning or afternoon -suggested 10am-1pm or 1pm-4pm) to explore 'The Labyrinth Walk: Finding the Sounds of Self.' In this dynamic meditation, Ocian with SoundSeed Medicine Journeys will help participants find intention and way of walking and then play crystal bowls and other instruments while you walk creating a beautiful unique soundscape as you walk the path to centre and back into the world again. ",https://www.ociansound.com,,$150,"I am requesting a sun set space on the second stage if it is set up like last year, or an installation space to set this up all weekend. Either way im fine with. The Dome is too small with not enough air circulation to be holding deep sacred space. As well, I was given a 7pm space and the music was over bearing for a sound journey to take place at the same time. 
The candles will be amazing in the grass there and if possible, I'd love to be set up to the sound system at the stage... 
$150 is mostly for installation costs: candles, holders, fabric, signs, string fence.

CONSCIOUS MÄ€ORI SOULFUL DANCE N ROOTS, 
SPIRITUAL BEATS & BASS LOOPS 

This is a show of stunning contemporary MÄori music, dance, instruments, language, stories, costumes and lighting.

MÄmÄ Mihi is ""Mihirangi"", worldly renowned as Aotearoa NZ's Artist Activist and Queen of Live Loops. One of the world's first international touring female loop artists, Mihirangi of NgÄti RÄkeiora, NgÄti Waikorara, NgÄti RÄhiri and NgÄti Raukawa is a musical master in the art of songwriting & live-looping.

Mama Mihi is a songstress who has a tool-box full of musical magic; weaving live loops of vocals, intricate harmonies, tÄonga puoro (traditional instruments), guitar, keyboards, world percussion with beat-boxing, drums and earth shaking bass lines with lyrics that melodically and poetically speak to indigenous and environmental issues. Supported by the dance, vocals and performance of her MÄreikura the show is a colourful event of traditional and contemporary MÄori culture celebrating the power and talent of our MÄori women.

An artist-activist and a born entertainer, Mihirangiâ€™s naturalness, infectious laughter and her authenticity means she doesnâ€™t take herself too seriously. The refreshing aspect of her performance is the love and joy she has of live-improvisation and spontaneous crowd participation, her fearlessness and inclusivity draws her audience into the heart of her performances and into to the spirit of the magic she creates.

The MÄreikura, recognized as female supernatural beings with noble whakapapa, genealogy, are Rita Peihopa of NgÄpuhi & Tiana King of NgÄti Kahungunu ki Wairoa, NgÄti Whatua and Te Rarawa. Both who have been fully immersed in the Maori language and cultural revitalisation movement, and have an exceptional love of all things MÄori to include both traditional & contemporary song & dance. Our MÄreikura are both competitive kapahaka traditional performers and teachers of their language, culture and haka. Rita is a highly talented in traditional poi and mau-rÄkau, MÄori weapons & martial arts. Tiana is a stunning and passionate contemporary MÄori dancer, with a background in haka theatre and contemporary dance. Together the girls have performed on many festival stages and have professionally competed regionally and nationally for Te Taha Tu, a traditional Maori Performing Arts group.

This is the first year that Mihirangiâ€™s new show â€œMama Mihi & the MÄreikuraâ€ are touring internationally and already the year is nearly booked out for the Commonwealth Games, Europe, Canada and New Zealand.

â€œWeâ€™re taking this new show on the globe circuit to inspire the positive changes that we must make as a human family and we do this through sharing our traditions in a contemporary way that celebrates indigenous values that honour our relationship with Papatuanuku - Mother Earthâ€ Mama Mihirangi.



â€œShe's just brilliant... in the 30 years I've toured the world I've never seen anything like her"" Ali Campbell UB40

""...infectious joy oozes from her very being, and captured our hearts... one of the most exciting, original and conscious solo performers of Australasia... an honour to watchâ€ The Agency Victoria Australia

â€œHer commanding presence will have you spellboundâ€ NZ Herald

â€˜The world is full of musical prodigies, but Mihirangiâ€™s got them all beat: Between her appetite for musical adventure, her MÄori roots, and her political convictions, she's the perfect model of a 21st-century shaman and starâ€ The Georgia Straight - Vancouver

My wife (singer/rapper) and I now share a beautiful 17 month old daughter, Naevia, and we have been trying to find something just like this to include her in. We would love to be a part of your growing gathering and see what its all about! Below is my career in a nutshell. 

Official bio:

2-time Vancouver Island Music Award winner and WCMA nominee â€˜Immaculateâ€™ has pursued his life passion - writing, recording, producing and performing profanity-free hip-hop â€“ for close to 15 years. Although his tastes and styles have evolved, his dedication to creating high quality, meaningful tracks that speak directly to his audience, has never wavered.

Consistent, creative effort and collaboration has paid off. Immaculate has earned his reputation as a strong live performer having toured across 8 countries with established names including Machine Gun Kelly (MGK), Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Apathy and Celph Titled (the Demigodz) and Zion I and rocking festivals like Center of Gravity, Keloha, Hidden Music Festival, the Groove, YAA fest and the Golden Sound Festival and warming up audiences for numerous established names such as A$AP Rocky, Three 6 Mafia, Xzibit, M.O.P, Masta Ace, Wu-Tang, Souls of Mischief, Bliss n Eso, Warren G, Swollen Members, Shad, Illy, Zion I, Classified, Madchild, Sweatshop Union, DL Incognito, Moka Only, Emotionz, Kyprios, Sonreal, Snak the Ripper, Evil Ebenezer and many more.

The critically acclaimed rapper has also developed a solid buzz with the sales of thousands of copies of his 6 solo albums, his music charting on college radio, and winning several songwriting competitions. Immaculate has 6 official music videos one of which earned him a BCIMA nomination for 'Video of the Year'. Other critical recognition came when he was named â€˜winnerâ€™ for his track â€˜Destructive Behaviorâ€™ (reaching over 25,000 plays in it's first week) in an International song contest hosted by Life and Death Productions of Finland where he competed against hundreds of entries from around the world. Immaculate won first place in another world-wide collaboration contest for â€œWhoâ€™s the Illestâ€ hosted by Arizona's Cryptic Wisdom and also made it to the finals of both the 2014 and 2015 Unsigned Only competition with over 10,000 submissions from over 100 countries.

His sixth independent release â€˜Solitudeâ€™ highlights a new depth and maturity in his writing and production and features powerful tracks drawing from a recent family tragedy exemplifying the growth of an artist reinventing himself with every song.

Immaculate has emerged as a significant voice in hip-hop â€“ a voice well worth listening to.

High quality wireless mics are preferred, but if not, just the classic SM58 or better is fine. 

I'm assuming our daughter would be free but just want to confirm that the family can get in with me.. Darice, my wife, is the second 'band member' - so just us three.

4/26/2018 23:00:02,Time Nomads,wongela.d@gmail.com,,"A Time Nomad travels back in time and place to commemorate revelations. This is an interactive experience that will allow you to send postcards to your future self. Time Nomads is a natural extension of my previous work, Global Nomads, a photo series dedicated to leaving countries better than found. It intends to explore two prominent issues in Canada:cultural identity and mental health. 

The concept is for festival attendees to:
1. Pick up a blank postcard from the â€œOpen Hereâ€ side of the mailbox
2. Capture their elevated and euphoric thoughts and immortalize it in the postcard
3. Include their own mailing addresses
4. Put it in the â€œDrop Offâ€ slit of the mailbox (locked to secure privacy)

I will then send out the uplifting messages back to them 6-8 months later when Seasonal Affective Disorder and other mental illnesses are heightened. Once more, by the time the postcards are mailed back to the attendees, it will be a great reminder to purchase their passes for Blessed Coast Festival 2019! ;) 
 
While the message will serve as an uplifting reminder of sun-kissed joy in the dead of winter, it also holds a deeper meaning. Every year, 1 in 5 Canadians experience a mental health or addiction problem, and 10-15% experience mild to clinical forms of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Mental disorders and substance abuse often go hand in hand, and can affect our thought processes, causing us to focus on our current misery and forget the times we felt great or even normal. Time Nomads is a harm reduction tool that attempts to link our good past experiences to our future mental health.

",https://www.facebook.com/we.are.global.nomads,,Each postcard costs an average of $1.10 to produce and mail out.,"Additional Info 
The Postcards
There are 30 different postcards to choose from; the artwork on each postcard is a portrait of an original face painting from the series: Global Nomads. I sat with 30 different subjects of various mixed cultural backgrounds, and painted the flags of their countries, or origin, on their faces. 

The Installation
 The Time Nomads mailbox will be placed in a visible and convenient location on festival grounds. The â€œOpen Meâ€ side will be unlocked with blank postcards and several markers for festival goers to use, while the â€œDrop Offâ€ side will be locked with a slit to allow completed postcards to be deposited. Some completed postcards are anonymously shared on the Instagram page: @Time_Nomads. As you can see from the attached draft images, the mailbox is illuminated by LED lights and has a secure, and eye-catching design. It is portable and extremely easy to set up and take down. ",

Biography

""One of Vancouver's punchiest indie singers.""  Fish Griwkowsky, Edmonton Sun

Sarah Wheeler is queer artist and recent cancer survivor who is defined by power house vocals and an indomitable positive spirit.  A blazing live performer.  Although she has enjoyed collaborating with other musicians, lending her vocals to recordings such as â€œA Small Wonderâ€ by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and sharing the stage with artists including Dan Mangan and Tanya Tagaq, this Vancouver-based artist has consistently remained focused on writing and performing her own music.  

Stuart Derdeyn from The Province reviewed Wheelerâ€™s work by saying, â€œthis is a very solid effort from an artist who has always had it but really tapped the right points and doesn't miss hereâ€.

Life changing experiences inspired Wheelerâ€™s upcoming unreleased album Revival.  Having been diagnosed with cancer and undergone treatment that kept her from performing for a year, Sarah wrote much of what would become her newest album during that time.  Wheeler wrote, performed, produced and recorded all of the songs for Revival, giving it a perspective that is uniquely homemade.  The result is a collection of songs with an unforced honesty and message of positivity through dark times. 

Wheelerâ€™s musical heritage was handed down to her through her grandfatherâ€™s pioneering efforts as a jazz pianist in local Vancouver clubs during the 50â€™s and 60â€™s.  In that period he backed jazz greats including Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr.  Sarah's mother had music in her blood.  She started teaching Sarah to sing before she could walk, and raised her in a household amidst the sounds of classic rock n roll, blues, jazz, and country music. Growing into a seasoned recording artist has been a natural progression for Sarah.  In the present day pop culture climate of false celebrity, Sarah is an old fashioned believer in remembering that the true power of music is the love of it.  

Sarah Wheeler is a third generation Vancouver born Canadian singer/songwriter who has leant her vocals to recordings such as â€œDonâ€™t You Think We Should Be Closerâ€ by Edmonton's Mark Davis of Old Reliable, and played live with artists including Mike McDonald of Jr. Gone Wild and The Be Good Tanyas.  None of which means anything without something to say.  Wheelerâ€™s new album is a true Revival.

Sarah Wheeler has an ""effortlessly big voice which falls somewhere between Chrissie Hynde and Neko Case.""-Adrian Mack The Georgia Straight

An Intimate exhibit of surreal  and live art!
 
My greatest success over the years has been sharing the gift of inspiration with others. Recent revelations have aided me to highlight this important intention for my 2017 festival tour. If I could carry only one message through my art it would be this simple but powerful verse:  â€œInspire Loveâ€  To your Neighbor, your friend, your son your daughter , the stranger you shared a smile with!  We all seek and aspire towards a positive epiphany at this particular cross road.     Through live art, self expression is a well loved journey both inwards and outwards!  Ineffable benefits are abound for the artist and beholder! What improv painting unfolds on my canvas further reflects another facet of my inner self.. Perhaps even a cue to the next path on my vision quest.   My past esteemed artworks have held upmost detail to a ethereal theme, and through this artistic style I envision my further transcendence in art.  Baby blue, pink and mint, a splash of black white, rainbow.. 8 years experience, and with each year passing my talent progresses; the best is only yet to come! I am more than excited to offer for 2017 â€œInspire Loveâ€  Live art by Rae Vena  
 Otherworldly, at first glance, a jumbo flower hangs down, art nestled between its petals.. A round canopy hangs from above, each pastel petal flows gently in the wind revealing its inner artful purpose. Inside, a nest of rugs & pillows surround an intimate exhibit of surreal art . In the center a blossoming live art painting takes host ! My art environment is part installation, part performance -for this is where my live art magic will take home for the weekend. By nightfall the glimmer of lights further invite observers to explore the art locus. Eclipsed by day, luminescent night sky will glow with curiosity on the inside floret. A live art hub,  where you can meet the artist, see the process and of course share space with others in creative conversation. This project is designed & will be handmade using as many up-cycled materials as possible. The top of the canopy is pvc tubing attached to roped pulley system. Pastel fabrics will be cut & sewn into the petals, then fitted with a bottom casing for water resistance. This canopy is decorative as well as useful for protection against rain, or simply roping off the art & displaying a ""closed"" sign during off hours for dancing! The essential benefit of hosting a space throughout the weekend is that guests can periodically visit to see an ongoing live art exhibit. Plans include fabricating a lock box for paints & tools of my trade & create a secure free standing wall from repurposed materials. If my timeline and costs doesn't permit the build of these extra elements, a heavy based easel will be secured  & a patio umbrella used as a base for my live painting. My installation is best suited under a tree to easily hang the canopy from above, if necessary a free standing method can be implemented with the patio base. I suggest distance of 30 meters or less to available electricity, and placement within earshot of a stage for musical inspiration!

Facilitated by the sound vibrations and harmonic melodies of the piano, flute, crystal bowls, medicine drums, chimes, and many more, you will float along the sacred sound current back home to your self. Your soul will also be serenaded by the light frequencies Astaria channels through her voice. Your cells will be harmonized, DNA activated, and awareness awakened as you gain clarity, inner peace, and a heart-high.

Astaria is a multi-instrumentalist, a soul singer, and a carrier of light for this world. She is a certified Sound Healing Practitioner, Reiki Master, Shamanic Medicine Practitioner, and trained Counsellor. In addition to creating community gatherings, she also offers private sound therapy sessions to hold space for clients who wish to explore their soulâ€™s mission, release self-limiting patterns, and find their way back home to their truth. 

â€”â€”

Expect the unexpected when participating in one of Astariaâ€™s sound journeys. She will envelop your being with various sounds and melodies channeled through her voice, as well as the harmonizing vibrations produced by an array of instruments. Each instrument carries itâ€™s own song, spirit, and vibration, offering a different experience of self when heard. Listen and choose your own adventure as you close your eyes and journey along the sound current, navigating the depths of your soul, and connecting with higher vibrational realms. Remember who you are and where you come from when you hear the ancient sounds of your origins. 

â€”â€”",https://www.lightofsound.ca,,200-500 (depending on what your budget allows) ,"I work with a variety of instruments and will need a cord to connect my piano keyboard to the amplification system and power.  In smaller settings I play acoustically, in a larger setting I will need two mics (with stands and cords) for amplifying the sound of my crystal bowls and steel tongue drum. I have a vocal mic I can bring, otherwise, I will need a 3rd mic provided for my voice. I enjoy the effect of reverb added to the sound. ;)

My sound journey would best be experienced to either open or close an evening. To open, I would start with a meditation to bring everyone into a high vibe resonant state, primed to receive the musical expressions shared thereafter. 
To close the evening, I would intend to bring everyone into a grounded state, connected with each other and their temple bodies, to seal the energy received prior, and to send everyone off into a blissful state for the rest of their night.

Thank you so much for your consideration in providing a space for me to offer my sound at Blessed Coast Festival. I participated last year in the Healing Hut, sharing private sound sessions by donation, alongside a group of other wonderful healers. I feel strongly that my sound expression will be better received this year in a group setting, where our community will gather and collectively raise our vibration in the weave of the sound tapestry that I will create.
I am soooo excited to participate and share my unique expression with this magical community that comes together for Blessed Coast. 

Thank you for all that you do to create such a beautiful high vibe festival. <3 xo

I started playing classical piano from a young age and eventually fell in love with the instrument. I was then pulled into improvisation and jazz, and soon enough I began composing electronic bass music. I am now dedicating all my energy towards a music career and have just begun a jazz piano degree at Grant Macewan University. My vision is to combine the powerful sounds of electronic music with live piano into a combination which elates the dance-floor and inspires humanity.

Over the last year, I have made many moves to advance my career. I released my first album titled 'The Vault' on December 2015, and have since released an EP titled 'Primal Waking' which features my best music yet (https://soundcloud.com/pauermusic/sets/primal-waking-ep). I played for the closing ceremonies at Astral Harvest last summer, so I have experience playing at festivals (link: music starts at 05:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FLB4or938&t=564s). I am a competent pianist and am constantly practicing to become the most well-rounded musician I can be (you can check out my instagram for piano clips: https://www.instagram.com/pauermusic).

My music could be described as deep rhythmic bass mid-tempo with strong chord progressions and ethereal soundscapes. The set I would throw at your festival would have 'thick midtempo vibes' most likely suited for night-time. Like I said, I am currently dedicating all of my energy towards becoming the best musician I can be, and I genuinely believe that my performance would bring something really special to this festival.",soundcloud.com/pauermusic,,$500,"I would feel very blessed for the opportunity to share the fruits of my artistic labor at this festival.

Yin Yoga Sessions - 
One of the styles of yoga I teach and love is yin yoga Yin Yoga is a deeply meditative practice where poses are held for 3 - 5 minutes each in order to begin release of connective tissue I teach classes that focus on certain Meridians in the Chinese Medicine system which correspond to certain elements and organs Each one focuses on a different organ for example the Water Element class focuses on the Kidneys, Wood Element focuses on Liver, ect ect 
The classes are about an hour long and are juicy done in the evening by candlelight But they are lovely anytime of day! These classes can be a really sweet contribution to the festival vibe as they are deeply relaxing and give people an opportunity to come into harmony with themselves and the elements, while having a profound detoxifying effect on the organs

Cakra System Yoga Sessions
I also teach classes centered around the Cakra System These classes focus on different pranayama breathing exercises as well as kriyas energetic cleansing, mudras, and some physical movements and visualizations that charge up the different Cakras I either teach one class which starts at the root cakra and works its way up the Cakras to the top of the head, or I teach different classes which focus specifically on one Cakra the entire time These sessions often leave people feeling energized, clear, and connected to their spirits

Hatha and Vinyasa Flow Sessions -
I also love to teach Hatha flow and Vinyasa flow classes I weave mudras, pranayama and kriyas together with physical classes that range from vigorous Power Vinyasa to mellow Hatha flow These can be nice classes to do early in the day, to get people charged up for the rest of the festival

This is what I am willing to offer, any or all of it, depending on what the festival is interested in incorporating! If I can contribute any of those things above, let me know  

I'm happy to exchange these classes for a festival pass, but depending on the resources of the festival, if it's possible for me to receive payment, as a practicing yoga instructor of course I would apriciate that

You see the future, full of exciting possibilities You're already making a difference in people's lives You just wish more folks understood the mojo of who you are, what you do, and how you roll 

This is a workshop on how to story yourself into being 

We'll explore your story of origin, and discover the untapped power of your story All based on the principles that character trumps credentials and presence trumps performance Storytelling is like fortune-telling Are you choosing the right story for the future you want to create?

Yoga is about the resolution of opposites About union and connection to source Storytelling is one of the deepest forms of yoga A way to access your inner-most knowing And express it to the world in a way that awakens the heart, resolves conflict, and makes things whole 

You already are a storyteller We all are Question is, do you know the stories you inhabit? Are you telling the right stories for the future you want to create? How do you get others to see what you see? 

Story is a verb That's where the magic of story resides In the conjugation of your life's experiences into wisdom Where you recognize the inherent choice in every moment to define the meaning and path forward When you change, the story has to change Because the stories you tell literally make the world

26/05/2015 15:45:02,Jocelyn Lee,jocelynlee28@gmail.com,Workshop,"I created Koi Chi Healing for all the services I offer, and for this festival I was hoping to offer one of my workshops

Depending on what your festival needs I have a couple of workshops I'd really like to share with others I have spoken to Kala about my circumstance of dates I will not be able to attend till the 22nd of the festival, and hope what I can offer will be helpful :


THE ART OF PERCEPTION EXPRESSION
This is a 3 hr creative expression/perception expansion workshop! Art supplies will be provided AND you get to take home your creations : will need to have a cap on how many people, preferably around 10-20, can attend as I'll need to get the right number of canvases for people to paint/use/take home

""This creative workshop are for those who simply want to express in a judgement-free way through art, all the while gaining new insights and perceptions on creative expression Often people feel that creativity is reserved for the arts, let me tell you it is absolutely not! : I think it is imperative to remember that the word creativity stems from the root word, ï¿½ï¿½Createï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ so a scientist who isnï¿½ï¿½t artistic, is creative when they create a new theory; or a mechanic is creative when they build a motor-run bicycle We are always creating in life So donï¿½ï¿½t be afraid to create whatever you imagine, this is what this space and workshop is for, to gain a new perspective on creative expression""

I created this workshop after my own plant medicine journey with mushrooms & painting and learned so much about the way we perceive expression, communicate our expression, limit our expression and most significantly - how our expression creates perceptions And so I want to share what I've learned, and hope that they too will leave with a new perception about expression It will be 3 hours of laughter, smiles, heart connections, new perspectives, full expressions and authentic selves

We will start with introductions as well as our intentions guided by an oracle card draw and an explanation on the purpose of this creative expression workshop, then we will spend a full hour creating freely through paint & mix-media and music I will go around and aid in bringing into consciousness the choices they are making with art, then the final hour will be for sharing and discussion on the different perspectives we receive from other's creations - then the creator will share their original intention

All that you need to bring with you are clothing that can get paint on it as youï¿½ï¿½ll be painting/creating with hands, and come with a positive attitude, open heart & mind

The cost per person is $3000 original is $50, but with no tea/snacks - $30 This is negotiable as well though for your festival - this will cover the art supplies used as well as the one you take with you

_____________________________________

HEART EXPANSION: I AM TO WE ARE
This is a 15-2hr workshop - there does not have to be a charge for this workshop I would prefer to keep it down to a size of 10-14 people

It is based on the practice of Ho'oponopono, while understanding what oneness feels like on a very intimate and personal level

The purpose of this workshop is to break through the mental understanding/limitations of oneness - to not just simply say ""Namaste,"" ""We are one,"" ""I see you in me,"" etc without truly understanding how it feels to move from the ""I AM"" to ""WE ARE"" To bring this New Earth of wholeness & oneness into reality, the oneness must be tangible to our hearts and body as well

So we begin with an introduction/sharing circle of why we have wanted to participate and what we feel like oneness meansï¿½ï¿½; I will also speak briefly of seeing oneness in everythingï¿½ï¿½ Then we will do a short guided meditation, to centre us and open our hearts to the journey we are about to embark on Then we will sit across another person we've never met before and move through the practice of Ho'oponopono ""Goodbye, I'm sorry - Please forgive me, Thank you, I love You""ï¿½ï¿½ After we will share again how our experiences were Rounding off with a group hug/circle where we place one hand on our hearts and one on the person's heart to the right of us Then end with a OM and Namaste!ï¿½ï¿½

If you are short in healing practitioners I can also offer my Crystal Healing and/or Shamballa Reiki as well :
_____________

I hope that these options will fit with your festival! It would be great to also know what the processes is for the teachers if they are doing it in exchange for a ticket Ie how long, how many times, meals? etc

The Dream Catcher is a widely recognized symbol associated with the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island North America, attractive to many for its beautiful appearance and the promise of good dreams As awareness and concern of cultural appropriation continues to inform our increasingly globalized world, this is an opportune time to revisit the history, cultural context, and deep teachings of the Dream Catcher, which remain more relevant than ever in helping us relate to ourselves and each other from a place of gratitude and interconnectedness 

In this 25 hour teaching, participants will learn about the origin stories, history, and philosophical underpinning of the Dream Catcher while working together to create sacred space for the entire festival We will weave a Dream Catcher within a clearing, using surrounding trees as anchor points for the outer rim The resulting form will provide a space for mindful retreat over the course of the festival, sheltered by trees and blessed by the community spirit of workshop participants Therefore, it would be ideal for this teaching to run on the first day

15/07/2015 17:58:40,Chris Pisesky,cpisesky@ualberta.ca,Workshop,"Hello beautiful people!
8 years ago I graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in honors genetics  At the time I was expected to begin medical school, but I was disillusioned and upset at the little attention that was paid to what we call the placebo  Furthermore, it was difficult to see how any real evidence could be found when the modern medical establishment knows so little about consciousness itself  During my last couple years of my 5 year degree, I could only find a few researchers who were genuinely tackling the problem, and found my higher level genetics professors stumped when I asked questions that reached into the holes at the foundations of modern biology and medical research  There are so many anomalies simply being ignored because they do not fit into the current medical paradigm of reality  These anomalies cause discomfort within the minds of these researchers and doctors, who choose to ignore the science and continue on as though nothing happened, but science is about the pursuit of truth no matter where it takes you
The last 8 years have led me to every corner of the planet to study with Yogis, Monks, Shamans of the amazon, and to unique and cutting edge research labs all over the States, Canada, and Europe  What I found is a growing body of evidence to show how powerful our minds are when it comes to the manifestation of a strong healthy body, and an increasing number of researchers tackling the question of the placebo in honest, open minded ways  What I also discovered was the huge body of evidence uncovered by physicists over the last 100 years  None of it was taught in any biology classes, which is why modern medical research hasn't the slightest clue about what consciousness really might be  These physicists were never looking for answers to the consciousness riddle, they were trying to uncover the basic workings of the universe, but as a by-product of their curiosity, they have shown us an incredible amount concerning the question of consciousness  Finally a couple years ago, the BBC documentary 'What is Reality' was the first mainstream documentary to attempt to explain to us that it is impossible to understand reality without understanding the role consciousness plays in its creation, and that you are now an outsider in the world of physics if you deny that consciousness has an effect on the physical universe  Nowhere is that more important than with our bodies  We cannot accept the placebo without accepting that the placebo is actually in effect 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that more than anything, our expectations and outlooks for our current and future state of health are what drives the wellness or sickness of our being
In order to complement my scientific understanding of what is happening between our mind and body, I have studied the mind through psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, NLP, the teachings of Buddhism, and I have trained to teach Yoga and meditation  This workshop is not only about sharing the framework of the new health paradigm coming from science, but to help with the understanding of what we can do to change the beliefs and paradigms we hold in our unconscious  Yoga is not simply a tool to maintain the fitness of the body, as is commonly believed in our western world, but it is a tool to help with mental stress and the creation of positivism  So many of us are stuck in habitual negative mental thought patterns, but there are so many ways to overcome this and take control of our own happiness  Happiness is something that comes from within, from our paradigms and beliefs about the world, and in actuality has nothing to do with outside circumstances, but to the way we react to those circumstances  Through this workshop I try to empower people with not only a framework of knowledge but with some basic tools like visualization meditations to help create this positive state of health  Even at the National Institute of Health, the medical 'old boys' institution in Washington DC, research is coming out weekly to show that we have the power to very specifically up-regulate hormone production or immune response in our bodies through visualization techniques, meditation, and specific yogic asanas 
For the last 2 years, I have been travelling through Australia  I am about to be purchasing a few hundred acres of land in the north okanagan with some friends to start a sustainable farming project with a permaculture and yoga school  Most of Australia, was actually about courses and wwoofing, but I was inspired by the festival scene there  I was enjoying festivals, but felt a desire to give back a little more to the experience  Some friends convinced me I should start hosting workshops, and over the past 2 years I have done over 20 workshops and the workshop has evolved with every experience
I have learned that the most effective way to share this understanding is to lead the workshop as a guided group discussion  I have the framework, the knowledge, and the depth of examples and experiences to share that I could speak for hours in front of a group, but with something so sensitive that every one of us has so much personal experience and perspective on, Ive found that encouraging as much discussion and sharing from the group is a far more effective way to get the point across  That being said, Ive learned several techniques which have helped me maintain order in a discussion that can bring up so many emotions
At the moment I am very busy starting a community futures small business program to help me avoid any mistakes with this big project, and searching for property  I am however happy to answer any questions you might have  I still dont have a website, although a friend is helping me slowly build one, and there is no formal presentation or powerpoint I can send you  
If you have a projector, it would help me get a few points across with short videos I have on my computer, but those are not necessary either  At the festivals in Australia, I was generally given an hour and half or two hours, although I spoke to several communities where the discussion  reached almost four hours  2 hours is more than enough though  Ive done the workshop on beaches, under festival tents, and in large rooms, so the location doesn't really matter, what matters most is the intimacy and a space where we can be uninterrupted for the time of the workshop  
I understand that this letter is coming a bit late, but there is no problem for me to join you guys if you have a bit of space you want filled up  The subject of the workshop is unique and has always excited people, and the main purpose I have in sharing is to empower people to understand the mind body connection so that they can live a healthy life  It has been 4 years since the last time I was sick, and this is something I am hoping to help others realize is possible
Thanks, and Im looking forward to hearing back from you

Learning how to make soap is a life skill that helps people break free from relying on industrial made, chemical products It inspires and informs people to be more aware of what they're putting on their skin, and to be more self reliant in a practical and hygienic way 

I demonstrate how to make soap using accessible things such as coconut oil and olive oil, a recycled juice container and dental floss

Over the years I've taken some of the concepts I've learned through the work with the horses and transmuted them into other offerings that can happen without the presence of the animals themselves One such offering is called 'Dreamride', a 15 hr somatic ceremony/workshop where participants explore Mary Oliver's famous question: ""Tell me, what it is you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?""

Dreamride is about dreaming and stalking our right wild lives; the ones where we can offer ourselves and our gifts as food to the world It harnesses the power and transformative potential of horse energy as we will ask for a herd of horses to carry us through a guided shamanic and somatic journey where we will ask for our dream to be revealed to us, and ask for a trail for us to follow to make it real in the world

Hope your day is beautiful

Id like to offer a yoga practice designed specifically for the needs of a festival goer This is the flow of it which Im open to revising

First finding stillness with guided meditation, connecting to the breath and to sensation

then embracing a playful joyous spirit, through facilitated silliness and self appreciative touch
 
invigotating the whole self with pranayama, 

dancing gracefully through asanas, mindfully opening energy chanels and nourishing the body for more dancing 

exploring vocal yoga physical and emotional release of vocal chords and Diphragm culminating with a sea of giggles, 

then a sea of oms

then a sweet savasana to seal in all the goodness   


I offered a similar workshop at Intention gathering, and wow, it was massively successful We were all so elated for it, you can ask Loretta Laurin or Tynan Rollo They are both organizers of intention and were both in my workshop  Im really excited to take what I learnt there and offer something even more delicious 

Thanks for reading and considering this! 

on the formal side, by way of credibility, I have a 200-h yoga teaching certificate from semperviva and have been practicing yoga since 2008 picking up a myriade of techniques along the way with experience in Hatha, Vijnana, Vinyasa, Yin, Kripalu, laughter yoga, and Kundalini yoga
I draw a lot of inspiration from Insight meditation I have complete 2, two week vipasana retreats, and I regualrly meditation
Ive also spent this entire winter going consistently to Facilitation Club and the Sense Workshop Serier, both every week Its been the perfect, informal education in facilitating group energy

Punctuate your festival by stretching sore dancing muscles and re-centering the mindThis class will engage the entire body, combining aspects of energetic vinyasa flow, relaxing yin yoga, breathing practice and meditation Practice self-care Experience the outrageously beautiful transient NOW: breathe, dance, flow 
 
Full description: This workshop is based on a series that I have developed while working with a variety of bodies over the past 4 years: the Luminosity Flow The name reflects the brightness we all have within us, and the ways in which festival culture creates a space in which we feel empowered to shine and share the gift of our own unique self with the world around us It is my intention that this flow will help your body feel bright, balanced and ready to play 
Weï¿½ï¿½ll begin with pranayama breathing practice to create a space of grounded awareness and full breath From there we'll build to a powerful vinyasa flow, engaging muscular strength and willpower to create heat and energy in the body, After a powerful and dynamic peak, the flow will gradually melt into a floor series, in which we'll practice yin restorative yoga - deep stretching that gets into the fascia and connective tissue of the body Weï¿½ï¿½ll engage and stretch from root to crown, from skin to spine, leaving no stone unturned Closing with a juicy body-awareness meditation, this class is designed to provide a space for self-care so that you can get the most out of your festival experience 
Enjoy the privilege of your ALIVENESS 
Explore the conjunction of space, matter, gravity, body, light, language, consciousness 
Experience present-ness Be in your body: breathe, dance, flow 

Teacher Bio: 
Lauren DeGaine
I recieved my BA degree in Yoga Teacher Training from Naropa University Led by Nataraja Kallio, it is the only undergraduate degree program in yoga in the United States The 3-year training explored anatomy, theory, philosophy, history and origins, physiology, therapeutics, the chakras and more My teaching philosophy revolves around well-being: yoga works with the body, but engages the mind and the emotions as well Yoga asks how can we use our practice to engage with the world as our most authentic self 

Often using the chakra system as a lens, my classes emphasize resetting the nervous system, developing body awareness, balancing the masculine and feminine energies and working towards a sustained experience of well-being Yoga is exercise, but it can also be a process which gradually transmutes discordant energies in the body toward a state of joy and heightened awareness

This winter I have had the privilege of debuting a handcrafted class, Sexy Restorative Flow, at Amethyst Dance and Fitness studio in Victoria, BC The inspiration from this class came from a desire to combine exercise with restoration, and to indulge my love of deep, sexy bass music This class gave me the opportunity to formulate and share the Luminosity Flow and the Warrior Goddess Flow Iï¿½ï¿½m excited to bring these sequences to festivals this summer

Open relationships? Polyamory? Relationship Anarchy? For many people, ethical and honest non monogamy is about freedom: freedom to love who you want, when you want, in whatever way feels authentic between adults and is mutually consensual It has a rosy reputation for being about not putting limitations on whom or how you love, being able to acknowledge your needs and desires and dreams, knowing that to expect one person alone to fulfill all of them is way too much pressure 

But what's the reality? How do the myths differ from the practical applications? How does it actually work in real life? Is non monogamy some enlightened approach to living, or simply another set of options for relating to other humans? Is there a Golden Path to polyamorous perfection, or is it a multilinear dance where we each get to decide what works for us as individuals? 

Whether honest non-monogamy is new to you, or you have years of experience, this workshop promises to offer fresh and insightful perspectives, and empower you with new tools to assist you in enjoying more fulfilling relationships!

My practice comes in the form of a device called a Pineal Activation Light The Light uses an array of LED lights, which are set to strobe at frequencies which correlate with powerful healing, and meditative states It does so by stimulating the pineal gland, causing a release of endogenous tryptamines, which in turn, bring uses into states similar to those experienced with entheogens They are used primarily in healing centers, float houses, yoga schools, and therapeutic practices, but I have managed to successfully implement the light at various festivals/events, with a fully portable set up The light is a unique representation of spirit, and technology, much like the festivals I have attending with it 

To run my practice, I will set up a space in which participants -- individuals and small groups -- would be able to relax an ground themselves, and experience the effects of the light This would be done in a quiet spot, amidst other healers, or nestled away in a quiet patch of art If I am able to manage the logistics of transporting an 8x8 copper pyramid frame, it shall be set up under that

This an updated version of the talk I gave last year at Blessed Coast, this time with a year's experience in the new story of love and actionable principles for conscious relating for festival goers   This workshop has been successfully delivered at Rainbow Serpent & Earth Frequency Australia, and Envision Costa Rica   

HEALING OF LOVE: Sex, Partnership and the Village
Duration: 90 minutes
Tech requirements: none

Many are beginning to question the current story of love: the belief that we must find ""THE ONE"": a partner who will grant our happiness and fulfill all our needs And yet, with growing divorce rates, betrayal, and stressed partnerships, the old story isn't working for many Others are experimenting with various models of open relationship and alternative forms - some finding joy but also much heartache 

New paradigm filmmaker Ian MacKenzie and co-facilitator Mya Hardman aka AppleCat speak about the research from Tamera peace village in Portugal, exploring the foundations the new story in love and sexuality How might we cultivate communities of trust to support the freedom to love without fear? 

Whatever your relationship form, monogamy, polyamory or beyond, this workshop will explore the role of the community in healthy partnership

Time: 15 hours could be an hour if needed also willing to do a couple of workshops 
I would need a sound system, there would be limited space in the workshop about 15 people also would need a space like a wall tent or a space with walls/far away from lots of people walking by/some sort of separation My partner Dalton would be assisting me in facilitating

Conscious breathing allows your unconscious to open and release repressed emotions Connecting and opening our breath we are able to become present, raising our energy to feel a higher vibration, getting unstuck from old emotions Opening our heart with each breath to be able to feel all that we are feeling without vulnerability, making room for spirit and authenticity 

To sum up a breath workshop: We would start with a share circle to create a safe and sacred space for everyone Then we would start a breath activation to get our energy flowing and breathing a bit heavier Next we would start the breath session by lying down and staying in a conscious breath for an hour with myself and my partner their to support and do a bit of hands on facilitation to help get the oxygen flowing through the whole body To end we would have another share circle for people that want to share there experience and to talk to myself or Dalton for any addition support or grounding that is needed

I would love to have the experience of facilitating a workshop at your festival! I am trying to get out there to gain more experience with my work and think that it would add a great, unique workshop to your lineup! I look forward to hearing from you!

02/03/2016 14:28:48,Asaya Heart Journey,asayadg@hotmail.com,Workshop,"Mystical Trance dance with Cacao medecine

What is a cacao ceremony? Chocolate + ecstatic dance healing and transformation Seriously, is anybody NOT down for some of that?


An Intentional ceremony to plant seed to hold space for each other to rise up as a community  with a heart opening experience with the cacao medicine, dance and breath 
Learn awareness about  energetic language and connection setting boundaries  Learn how to protect your energy, feel your self more ,  find your centre, use the elements to bring you to a blissful state

A space to learn how to use medicine with respect transforming our music festival experience into a healing journey of our body with awareness on how to heal  with dance, movement and breath 

Learn different shamanic dance ritual from all-around the world, tantra transformative eye gazing exercise, a deep journey for our masculine to hold space for the feminine to open up under the wings of the source 

My wish will be to bring my healing tipi to hold space during the whole week end as an intentional space to use medicine and to come back to to find our centre 
A space where we can share our gift, offer healing, support for each other, building community around it A goddess temple, a space where the masculine can treat the feminine with respect seeing the beauty softening up the goddess that we may still hide inside 
A space where we can rebalance our energy, where  we can get smudge and ground ourself
A space for healer to hold space where we can give and receive

What is cacao?
 Cacao ""just like the chocolate"" when drink pure into a warm drink mix in a special natural  magic intentional blend of plant medicine spice works as a natural anti depressive and a mussel relaxer When mindfully use with breath and healing dance awareness will send you into a beautiful natural ecstatic bliss Because of cacaoï¿½ï¿½s ability to increase your connection to your  inner self and your heart chakra, it aids in any transformational shift you are working towards, whether you are looking to deepen your understanding of who you are, release old patterns and traumas, or move into a more self-confident space Whatever your path, the intention is yours to set, and the cacao allows you to the insight and awareness to move towards that goal

Heart Journey Tipi is Giving back to the first Nation

The healing tipi is actually taking form in Mont Curry Asaya new age healer and Franky a First Nation elder Are starting to offer cacao ceremony , sweet lodge, traditional hoop dance class, survivor skills, permaculture courses, mystical dance and yoga Spreading a healing positive vibe to our land where trauma been experience in the past Bringing back the tradition, holding space for people of all colour to come to experience shamanic experience Our land offer women to step into their power teaching them also about nutrition, herbal medicine and garden skills, where children get to be creative and learn tradition that has been forgotten, where men are rising up, learning survivor skills and planting garden to provide to their family 

So in this project we would hope to get donation for the cacao that will be use to give back to the community and also to provide cacao medicine to the peoples, We have collect donation last year hoping to rise money for the community but we just paid for the cacao medicine

continuum that signifies the movement of energy It is this mind set of positive energy to
promote positive results that is danced into our existence
With the help of the help of the Goddess, and the powers of nature we weave our magick into action to support healing of our Great Mother Earth
Through the Spiral Dance we are provided the opportunity to connect to one another, and along with the momentum of the dance, we are propelled slowly inward, toward reflection,  turning to express and expand outward only when we have turned that small corner in the centre The Spiral Dance is conducted as a significant portion of a basic Wiccan Circle where the stated intention is to bring healing and respect to our relationship with Nature and the Earth, and to share in a celebration of community This involves the creation of the circle, the calling and establishment of the 4 quarters, elements, and directions, the statement of intention, the raising of energy through the spiral dance, chanting and drumming, the blessing, and the conclusion 

This is an all ages or family friendly activity We can conduct it with a dozen to a couple hundred people

techniques, mudras, and energy field exercises into the yoga class to make it
fun, engaging and semi-psychedelic
I have taught large classes as part of art and music festivals in the past and
they have been a great contribution to the atmosphere of those events I was booked for Blessed Coast last year and was so excited to teach there but had to cancel due to some complications in my life at the time I heard amazing things about the festival since then and am so excited to offer classes here this summer

As a teacher with experience teaching in festivals and musical events, I know how to keep the energy of the class playful, fun, and accessible to everyone who wants to participate
I can hold space for classes which
will bring people together, create a deeper sense of community and help to uplift the entire festival; once people are deeply connected with themselves and energized through the yoga practice, they can
have more to share with one another throughout the rest of the festival and
on the dance floor
I could hold a sunrise yoga class, or a morning/afternoon class, however best
fits the festival The class I guide will be one hour and is best suited to a
grassy area or any large, open space

The teachings Iï¿½ï¿½d like to offer come in the form of a one hour workshop about the different phases of the moon and how to harness the energy of each phase of the moon for a greater connection to the Goddess 

This session incorporates work with the archetypal philosophy of the cycles of the moon, and how to recognize and call upon these archetypes within our lives 
This workshop is practical, conversational and experiential; it incorporates guided meditation, dialoguing, lunar teachings, ritual, self reflection, conversation, and breath work so that people come out of this experience with a deeper connection to how the energy of the moon is present in all aspects of life We will also be sharing practices which we can do on our own after the festival which can help us to stay in tune with these rhythms

This workshop has been birthed from a four-hour workshop I run, called ï¿½ï¿½Tools for the Wild Womanï¿½ï¿½, which is geared towards those who menstruate Iï¿½ï¿½ve put the link to my website and to this full workshop below I was asked last year to create a one hour version of this workshop for the Vancouver Full Moon Medicine Gathering which would focus on embodying the lunar phases and be equally accessible to both genders So, here it is!

I always love running this workshop because as much as I see it inspiring people who attend, I also learn a lot from the conversation and the unique ideas people bring for honoring the lunar cycles in their own way I know Blessed Coast would be a perfect place for us to bring attention to, and share in the wisdom of, the lunar Goddess and Iï¿½ï¿½d be honored to hold that space

Primary Mantra being the Hare Krsna Maha Mantra 
I work shop could include a full break down and explanaition on all the features of said mantra The meaning of Mantra Man=Mind tra=to liberate, as just a taste 
What are the powers withing each word, ""Hare"" ""Krsna"" and ""Rama"" 
Also what is the benefit of chanting such names
Then could go on to a full call and response Kirtan, along with 2 or 3 other ""Kirtaniyas"" if permitted, and able to bring them up to the festival but most likely will be easy to do
Would also be honoured to be able to set a table up per donation of my spiritual masters books, Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayan Maharaja you can take a visit at bhaktistorenet or com to get an idea of what the books are like 

Oh also a little bit about myself sorry I am kind of excited as I write this 
but I am 23 and was born in the Bhakti tradition So talking and sharing about Bhakti Yoga is quite natural for me 
When I was around 11 years old I was taught the traditional mantras and methods for playing the traditional musical instrument for Kirtan, the Mridanga but a teacher from West Bengal, which is the birth place of the Mridanga, as well as Kirtan as we know it today 

I also travelled on a world tour for two months in 2011 with the world famous Hare Krishna Gaudiya Vaisnava artist,  Srimati Syamarani didi, as her personal servant And learned much more about the Science of Gaudiya Vaisnavism or the practice of bhakti Yoga in general You can see some of Srimati Syamarani dasi's art on her website, wwwbhaktiartnet as if possible, I would also make arrangements to have much of her art on display along with my Guru Maharaj's books 

And since that time it has been my primary goal in both my daily and long term plans to continue developing my practice as well as be able to share it with others, as is instructed by my Guru, Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayan Maharaja to all his disciples to try and follow 


So, long story short, if it was so possible to be able to share these gifts I have been so magnanimously blessed with, with my fellow Blessed Coast friends, I would be so grateful, and indebted 

I also would be 100% satisfied to just offer this as an exchange for entrance into this festival Aswell as one pass to have a friend come who can drive me and the supplies and perhaps her 8 year old daughter as well and potentially one friend to assist in the kirtan But whatever seems most fair 

Bless up~ and Hari Om!!!

In addition to teaching yoga, I also own my own business, Yoga Gypsy Creations  I hand create and sell yoga inspired jewelry mala beads and accessories such as lavender eye pillows, yoga mat bags, and a line of aromatherapy products such as yoga mat spray, body & massage oil, soaps and candles  I had a booth at the Squamish Farmer's Market all of last summer season  I am hoping to sell my creations again this summer at the market  

I would be so interested in being a part of your festival   I have recently started hosting Mala & Mantra Workshops in the Sea to Sky corridor I have one planned for Apr 23 at Yogacara and one in Vancouver on Apr 9 with an instructor from my school and her friends  I hosted two workshops in Pemberton last Fall with two separate stagette groups and they were a hit!!!

The following is the description of the workshop that I am hosting at Yogacara

Mala & Mantra Creative Workshop
In this special workshop you will create your very own Mala and then learn to use various mantras to bring about healing, peace, love and health Repeating mantras while using a Mala helps to cultivate and deepen a meditation practice This ancient practice enables one to release negative energy and to receive all that is positive and good in life We will end the workshop with an asana/yoga practice and all you need to do is come with an open heart to send out and receive positive energy

Since the workshop would require the cost of mala beads and supplies, I  am not certain that I could offer the workshop in exchange for a festival pass  I am definitely interested in a trade of some sort but my supplies would need to be covered  I would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this if you are interested in the idea  

Thank you for your time

The workshop begins with a guided meditation to enter the inner experience and cultivate the energy of compassion and concentrated awareness With this awareness and compassion present the participants are guided into creatively expressing their unique inner world through visual art The participants are encouraged and facilitated in nourishing self-compassion and non-judgmental perspective to their artworks, hearts and minds Then the participants are shown how to communicate with their own artwork and how this technique offers a vehicle for embracing ourselves In closing the artists are asked to share if they are comfortable what their inner world guided them to express as well as sharing their artwork A small closing loving-kindness mediation is guided and the workshop ends

Diana and I are both studying Expressive Arts Therapy at Langara College and we are fusing this practice with our meditation practice in hopes to offer a safe vehicle for self-compassion and the freedom of self-expression

The use of sound as a healing force is one of the most ancient human practices of medicine which is being rediscovered with profound implications in our modern era The ancients often used sound and music to treat the essence of the human being, the soul itself, as the finer energies of vibration are able to relate and connect to our deeper aspects This is also seen as getting to the very root of much dis-ease Beyond its healing applications, the whole paradigm of sound healing opens a new horizon of engaging an energetic sense of reality and particularly in connecting to the vibrational intelligence of the Heart This is literally a re-enchantment of the world, as our perception shifts to feeling our way through life, garnering union with the guiding wisdom of the universe and its subtle intuitive powers As we come to realize our source as vibrational entities, it changes the whole way we live, giving us new skills of empowerment to foster lives of evolving potential Using the voice as a healing tool emboldens this vibrational sensibility Participants will learn simple ways to use the voice as a sound healing instrument to transform energy blockages in our being, enthuse intention, transform our moods and how to utilize sound in groups to foster powerful unifying space Participants will be introduced to the use of sound and music as medicine drawing from the wisdom of the ancients and modern innovations The workshop will conclude with a mystical performance of the crystal singing bowls and a group chant for world peace ",,Yes,,,

Testimonial
ï¿½ï¿½It hardly feels appropriate to call what Luz Helena offers as a ""class"" or a ""workshop""  It would be more accurate to call it a homecoming With incredible grace, she guides you back to the very essence of who you are, utilizing her extensive wisdom of yoga and Kirtan as the map Without fail, I have left each ""homecoming"" feeling more grounded, centered, heart-opened, connected, sensitive, and clear  Luz Helena is a true Sherpa of the heart and you truly could not have a better guide on your side!ï¿½ï¿½

My given name is Kat Bickert but the name given to me by my guru is Maa Karuna Ananda, meaning Mother of compassionate Bliss

I would be teaching way for visionaries to deepen connection to what I call their ""Cosmic Essence"" through simple practices like ceremony, prayer, meditation and yoga I will teach the 8-Limb Formula to Cosmic Bliss Samadhi as passed down in the Ashtanga Yoga tradition from Rishi Patanjali in the yoga Sutras, explain an 8-step process to deepen connection & power to manifest vision through prayer, and the importance of mastering basic foundational yoga postures 

I will end the workshop by guiding in a special pranayama passed down to me by my guru that instantly deepens meditation and guide students through a body awareness meditation 

I mainly focus on teaching visionaries because those who have the vision for peace, harmony and abundance on earth, are the ones often working towards that end The issue is that many of us visionaries are up in the clouds with our big beautiful vision, yet our lives are lived incongruently to this vision in some way A large factor is that when someone with a great power of vision hasn't deeply grounded themselves in the physical world before performing their work, their actions have a large potential energy left untapped

By teaching visionaries the power of simple but deep grounding practices, their level of presence and awareness increases and the power to manifest their vision through their daily actions increases Through tapping into the internal reservoir of the Cosmic Sense of Self we awaken our Divine power and restore peace and balance",,Yes,,,

My name is Cody Wicks and I am writing to offer and open to teaching and facilitating at Blessed Coast this year I am currently doing communications, outreach, and event coordination at OUR Ecovillage in Shawnigan Lake One of my major projects here is creating the EDE Ecovillage Design Education program here, an extension to the Permaculture Design Certificate I have my Permaculture Teacher's Training by Cascadia Permaculture Institute, a certificate in Sustainable Community Development at SFU, a background in toxicology, and a lot of experience in social enterprise creation, crowdfunding, and consensus building!

I would love to do one of a few workshops If there is any interest in any of the following, please let me know and I will reply with a full description:

1 Intro to Permaculture - Working in whole-systems design, we can create and hold space in a way that is in alignment with what is Rather than asserting our will on the landscape, we can work with the landscape to create a holistic and easy way of life While supporting indigenous sovereignty, local plants and animals, we can integrate the 12+ permaculture principles into our life and our projects in all aspects 

2 Intro to Dynamic Governance consensus - Consensus works! We can empower ourselves and our communities by working in consensus to create the decisions without pushing an agenda on anyone We can use circles and mutual respect to create an intention for collaboration, while moving forward decisions quickly and in alignment

3 The Mutualism Hub - Social enterprise networking! Let's share what we do in circle, what we have to offer in abundance, and what we are looking for assistance with If we come from a place of service to Mother Earth, we can manifest in an ethical way! 

4 Ecovillages as Living Conscious Community Centres - What are ecovillages and intentional communities really doing? They are holding space to innovate on all levels of society, from the local community within the village, to the surrounding community, to the global peace pilgrammage currently occuring We are coming together as a species and beings around the planet to create a new story that is based on peace, acceptance, love, trust, and true justice Ecovillages are the sanctuary and consciousness hubs that are anchoring this space for us to connect and create the future we want

Hello! 

I heard about this festival through my friend Alex Sadowski We  both worked at Karma Food Co-Op in Toronto together! 

I have hosted a workshop called Calling All Change Makers in both Toronto,ON and Tacoma, WA 

Calling all Change Makers is a two hour creative forum based on Theory U for social innovators of all ages/disciplines to connect, explore, and cultivate change Participants find support for their passions, and create better alternatives together! 

Participants will leave knowing they have support, a greater knowledge of what resources they can utilize, and how their passions can develop further once their feet enter back into the world I can send you a powerpoint of the questions asked and the process if  you desire 

More information about Theory U can be found at the Presencing Institute: https://wwwpresencingcom/

Theory U is also the foundation for the Ontario Youth Fellowship Program called Studio Y 

I would be happy to do one or multiple workshops as the outcome is different depending on the participants involved https://wwwmarsddcom/systems-change/studio-y/studio-y-fellowship/

Ideally this workshop will be held right at the beginning of the gathering!

I will facilitate a workshop that spans the entire time of Blessed Coast by holding space for a self-directed Intro to Permaculture over the course of this gathering Weaving together with any other permaculture workshops offered, there would be three major parts:

1 The workshop: At the beginning of the festival, or part-way through, I would do a 1-3 hour workshop on permaculture We would go over the principles and the Permaculture Game would begin

2 The Permaculture Game: Find others throughout the course of the festival and connect around permaculture Discuss the principles based on the initial workshop, and write down any notes, important quotes, journal entries, or any other way to share our stories around permaculture at Blessed Coast

3 After the Gathering: Participants will have the option to complete a review of their experience and send it in to receive a Certificate that they have completed the Intro to Permaculture and played the Permaculture Game at Blessed Coast over their 72 hours there It will include questions written or drawn answers, a Facebook group for discussion, chance to submit designs for Blessed Coast and other gatherings to consider, and give links to resources and books that can help in their permaculture journey 

This is a great way to connect diverse people around permaculture It doesn't compete with any other permaculture workshops but is only improved by them, as people have a chance to play with and engage in their knowledge It gives them a certificate that they can then use to move into other areas of permaculture from a place of knowledge

02/06/2016 20:37:23,Joseph Presley,Josephjpresley@gmail.com,Workshop,"Title of workshop:
""Sustainability for millennial's""

Introduction: 
This is about a 30-45 minute group workshop that will help to inform and educate our current generation on how to design anything in a sustainable frame of mind Weather it be physical products, art, music, fashion, or even if you want to make your daily life more sustainable, this is the catalyst to get the natural reaction going!

Outline: There will be a short introduction of myself and background, followed by a group exercise involving participants and getting them thinking in the right state of mind! We will then dive into the main focus of the workshop, 2 case studies The first is a look at the declining industry of physical print design vs against the ever growing digital graphic design industry This will lay out what some people already know about sustainability, which is the environmental part But in the next case study, the story of a sustainable restaurant in Vancouver BC that is striving to stay above water in tough times while battling against the corporate chains that just feed on profits This topic will help to grow everyones understanding of what it means to be ""sustainable"", over catch phrases like ""going green, or being environmental/social conscious"" This will cover most of the lecture, if there are not too many questions throughout this period and time is going well, another case study or example will be presented to further expand upon the subject From there we will participate in a second group exercise where we come up with ideas in small groups of products of ideas we can make more sustainable using the information we just learned There will be a short conclusion and information given on where to find out more, and time for final questions at the end


Some of the key notes addressed will be:
-The definition of sustainability, ï¿½ï¿½Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsï¿½ï¿½
-The three pillars of sustainability: enivronmentally sound economically viable, and socially just
-The principles of sustainable design: learning from natural systems, respect for energy/resources, respect for people, respect for place, respect for future, and systems thinking
-practical steps designers can take to make a difference: design for use, dematerialization, design for disassembly, substution, localization, transmaterialization, design for durability, design for reuse unintended & intended, and redesigning the system 
-Setting up sustainable framework, ie: LCAlife cycle assessment, The Green table Network, Oceanwise certification, making your own DIY

A little about myself: I am a Sustainable Graphic Designer that grew up in Vancouver, BC I Studied at the vancouver art institute and graduated with a Bachelors of applied design, minoring in sustainability I have been working freelance for the last year and a bit now, and before that I worked in a firm and some corprate positions ",,Yes,,,

10/06/2016 22:43:30,Cody Wicks,mutualismhub@gmail.com,Workshop,"Emergence

We are in a period of emergence We are letting go of control and hierarchy, and allowing, surrendering, to what is wanting to come through us What is wanting to emerge 

We can connect with and honour ourselves and through this, connect with and honour others 

I would love to hold an emergence circle and workshop for Blessed Coast Of course, this nessesarily means allowing for what wants to emerge in the circle 

Most commonly, this will go in two general directions:

Inwards: I-circle inside ourselves, we will share what is going on for us, and our reflections and mirrors will share what this brings up for them in what they are going through, and so-on This is a sign that we as a group have healing to do together in the interior of our souls Our karma Our conditioning Our memories It can be seen in many lights, through  many stories In a safe space, we can go inside

Outwards: O-circle will usually start with an I-circle round, where we go inwards and find that what we want is to look outwards To see what we can manifest We may share our dreams, passions, loves, ideas, visions It will be facilitated in such a way that what wants to emerge will emerge In one workshop, we ended up self-organizing into 4 groups to brainstorm and create 4 crowdfunding campaigns for those that really had a fire going to manifest their passions in that moment Other times, we may do rounds and share what we are all creating, and leave space to connect afterwards and self-select into long-term relationships of manifestation 

It can take any shape, always for the highest good, into ourselves and into the universe around us Humanity is at an inflection point, where we move into the 'yellow' or 'teal' areas of spiral dynamics, seeing the full power of our collective experience, stories, and will And integrating it We are moving into a complex ecosystem where it is impossible to map ahead of time what is emerging, yet we can see patterns and work with what is 

This is also an intro to social permaculture workshop that will draw heavily on the permaculture principles

The problem is the solution: If a problem comes up, we will crowd source a solution through our collective spirit 

Respect and honour diversity: Any group that comes together is unique, and if we get away from our assumptions and expectations, this particular group can create something as unique as it is Something that could resonate through the planet in a wave and ripple of peace

Produce no waste: Everything we hear is a mirror in which to see our own consciousness As Alan Watts says, ""The eye can see, but it cannot see itself"" 

Use Edges and Value the Marginal: Will we see our edges as exciting areas of innovation, growth, and challenge Or will we see them as triggering and stress? I will hold space to go into whatever arises and value the marginal areas of our current consciousness as we expand together 

Observe and Interact: Through observation of ourselves, our triggers, our interests, our connections, our reflections, our mirrors, we can see and interact with the world in a way we otherwise cannot Together we are strong

Creatively Use and Respond to Change: I have no idea what will come up in this group Even if I did, things may change with no notice As a group, and as individuals, we can creatively use and respond to changes in the way this group comes together to find what spirit is trying to say through us 

Catch and Store Energy: What energy is coming with us? What is trying to emerge? It can be anything! What ever energy comes up, we will catch and store in quantum manifestation If we can hold energy into a solid space, it will be able to move through the system in a way that we want with intention 

Apply Self-regulation and Apply Feedback: As self-aware individuals, we can look inside and apply self-regulation and accept and apply feedback from those around us If the space is held safely and with intention, self-responsibility, and with love, we can use all reactions and responses to create a better world for ourselves and those around us 

Design From Patterns to Details: We can see the patterns in ourselves and those around us, we can see patterns in nature that indicate ways that we can move for a more sustainable and loving future Whether looking inwards or outwards, patterns can indicate the stories we need to listen to 

Integrate Rather Than Segregate: Sometimes we have a group with seemingly conflicting ideas, or rather stories, that come up This can be the greatest gift, if we are brave enough to stand and hold space for it We can find the overlap between even the most seemingly diverse set of stories, and show our common humanity and goals for peace and love on earth We all want to belong, let's be the change 

Use and Value Renewnable Resources and Services: Almost enough said there If we are creating and showing up from our highest good, from our passionate centre, we can channel from spirit and renew ourselves and the planet around us 

Use Small and Slow Solutions: Sometimes, taking the time to go around the circle is the most healing and innovative thing to do Giving each person a chance to hear and reflect on what their mirrors are showing them can be a huge gift Small and slow, we will create a new world outside of the time paradigm 



There are many ways this can go I am very open to doing a short workshop over a few hours as I am to having a space that we hold space for this throughout the entire festival This is my passion and journey in life and there would be nothing that brings me more joy than to bring an emergence point into Blessed Coast 

Much love,

I teach Conscious, Connected Breath as a healing modality/workshop  It entails participants to learn about breath and what it means to breathe with ease in their bodies and lives  This is a guided meditation and healing modality that gently unwinds the patterns of breath we have adopted over a lifetime
I play music and talk guests through a particular style of breath while they lay on their back in a comfortable position

I am available on sunday only and would love to join you
Thanks for considering, looks like a fantastic event

Exploring Plant Consciousness through the ï¿½ï¿½Music of the Plantsï¿½ï¿½ as a form of expression, beauty, and artistry

Using a device developed by the Damanhur community in Northern Italy, the participants will witness an auditory translation of the electrical fields of plants and hear their ï¿½ï¿½musical songï¿½ï¿½ first hand We will also see how the plant, via its song, responds to human interaction

Here is a link to an article about Damanhur and the technology

For me, dance is a true expression of our souls and also showing us our physical and mental blockages The way we move and are moved by Life is showing us a clear mirror of ourselves and can deeply contribute to our evolution  In this always accelerating world we are living in, dance is a powerful tool to clear the mind and come back to our senses Offering a dance floor where we can get out of the box, re-connect with our body/spirit and transcend the fears is one of the purpose of my offerings  In doing so, we are opening ourselves to the divine/sensual aspect of ourselves and taping in our healing power By creating a balance between guidance and free dancing, we enter in a sacred space where we can receive, share and grow

This offering is a journey where we let go of the mind and come back to embodying the Goddess/God that we are We open our bodies to the ï¿½ï¿½juicyï¿½ï¿½ aspect of Life, giving ourselves permission to move exactly the way we want to, the way it feels good for us! Integrating sensuality, letting go of the fear and coming back to beauty of the senses which are a doorway towards connecting with the divine

Here is a link for the last workshop i offered at the ''Conscious Goddess Festival'' at the same location a few weeks ago  You can find testimonials and more: http://theconsciousgoddessfestivalcom/#9946ef84-42bb-cl

11/07/2016 14:12:15,James Thomas,james@wordisout.ca,Workshop,"The Sacred Sharing Circle is a transformational process, in which participants are guided to share within a safe and open space their current external/internal challenges that are arising in life and/or within the festival experience in order to open up and receive the gifts/teachings which life itself are providing us with

In the end participants not only have the opportunity to strengthen their connection with and learn from one another, but also have a chance to re-connect with the teachings of the Medicine wheel and become better equipped to carry with them this practical tool of the sharing circle which, can then be utilized in our own communities and homes in order to assist with our ability to honour our relationships with ourselves, others and all that exists and transform our lives

""As a couple we have seen first hand within our own relationship, and with our two boys the importance and value of the sharing circle - which is the main reason why we travel the country sharing this tool within homes and schools  Recognizing it may be the most essential tool for us to utilize in order to re-connect with one another by creating the space to openly communicate our emotions in a safe, respectful way  Allowing us to gain a mutual understanding for one another while being able to practice the essential skills of expressing our emotions, being present/able to listen to one another, and recognize that we do in fact have the ability to process anything and everything we face in life - especially when we are able to do it together"" ",,Yes,,,

13/07/2016 11:07:25,Samuel Scott,ss1870@mybristolacuk,Workshop,"Dear Blessed Coast,
I would love the opportunity to offer poi spinning workshops at your festival! For anyone that doesn't know, poi spinning can be considered a circus flow art and involves spinning weighted balls on the end of strings, usually one in each hand Poi spinning originated as a Maori tradition to improve warriors wrist/arm flexibility and dexterity, and has now developed into a performance art, with fire performance and urban street circus being two major forms
I have personally been spinning poi for two years now, having performed with both fire and LED poi at various events, including the Whistler Blackcomb Fire and Ice shows I have also spent many hours teaching poi to various people including friends and more formal arrangements I can offer instruction right from complete beginner moves up to advanced techniques, performance considerations and improving general flow In terms of workshops I am happy to offer multiple workshops at different standards or just adapt to the class based on demand
I am an avid yoga enthusiast and mostly follow the Ashtanga practice although I have enjoyed many Iyengar and Hatha classes I would love the opportunity to be a part of and contribute to this event as I feel that is the best way to experience festivals
I hope you can consider my application, I look forward to hearing back from you!
Peace, love and my warmest regards,
Samuel Scott",,Yes,,,
