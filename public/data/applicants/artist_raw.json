When they got the whole pub up on their feet later that night at the open mic, starting a band just felt right. The girls started playing the Vancouver circuit with original reggae, folk and country tunes. Known for infectious grooves, super-good vibes and great jams, G&M quickly grew to become a powerful mix of 7 talented ladies and 1 bad-ass dude rockin’ some of the sweetest, most intimate venues in Vancouver. Each Ginger & Moonshine member writes their own music, stretching the band’s range to encompass everything from dub and reggae to salsa, jazz, blues, rock/pop and folk. Rich 4-part harmonies, violin, trumpet and keys give G&M’s music a beautiful, unified sound that transcends genres and makes you feel good.",

What I am offering is a one of a kind, unique performance merging live beatboxing with a high energy electronic set composed largely of my original productions! \r\n\r\nHere is my artist biography; \r\n\r\nIt's hard to believe the music blaring through the speakers is coming entirely from his mouth; with that rattling bass, layered in perfectly timed beats and dimensional sounds. The melody is there, you get lost in the beat, and just fall along with the drop. Beatboxing at it's finest. After all, you are only listening to British Columbia's top beatboxer, and one of Canada's top 16 from the Canadian Beatbox Championships. It's the perfect intro for the set he's about to mix; a variety of tunes, including many of his own productions, sure to keep any crowd swimming hard through those sound waves all through the night. Chrizpy Chriz is a show you simply cannot miss; stage presence, personality and, of course, talent all up on one stage. He is well known through the interior of British Columbia having placed a lasting impression on the many crowds he's provided with the gift of his sound art. You might have caught him rocking his decks at underground shows and festivals, including, but not limited to, Burning Man (NV, USA), Elysium (the Blue), Felurian Grove, Kicking Up Dirt, IUG Jamboree, Get Bananas, U4eeyah, and a spontaneous in-between performance at Envision (Costa Rica), opening for artists such as Snak the Ripper, Mark Instinct, Terravita, Mat the Alien, Meikulator (Perkulat0r and Alex Mei), Ill-esha, and Pigeon Hole. Headlining Cascadia NW (WA, USA) as part of the Future Perfect Events showcase, he shared the main stage with artists such as  Penny Wide Pupils, Kozmo, Willdabeast, Bleep Bloop, and Tipper. He's also played shows in California and Washington, pulling in crowds , and performed right alongside the well known Micheal Winslow. His YouTube reputation is also not a disappointment, with an ever-growing following of over 1100 subscribers, over 300,000 views, and holding a partnership with Fullscreen inc. Chrizpy Chriz is a performance you won't regret bringing to your stage or event. Prepare yourself for a show you won't forget. \r\n\r\nAt events and festivals, Chrizpy Chriz offers beatboxing workshops. Suitable for all levels, learn the basics of beatboxing as well as more advanced techniques and sounds. You'll also get to appreciate a short performance and there is always plenty of space to get any questions you may have answered.\r\n\r\nArtist Statement;\r\n\r\n\"I have fully immersed myself in the crazy world that is electronic music and the scene that come with it. Absolutely passionate about what I do, I have taken on music full time and am pouring myself into the ultimate creation of sound. I strive to create a positive vibe and keep a crowd dancing to an ever changing combination of beats and sound waves. One of my goals as an artist is to help merge the line between the electronic and the organic creation of sound.�\r\n\r\nI would just like to add a huge thank you for taking the time to review my application and take me into consideration for Blessed Coast 2016, I would be stoked for the opportunity to participate in this lovely event! I look forward to hearing back!\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\nChris Gouchie",

Kyler Schogen hits a \r\nsweet spot musically, that area just where rock, blues and folk converge. It is a place which \r\nmusically, is almost ideal, at least to my ears, a devout blues lover, who appreciates a good rock \r\nsong, and the lyrical strength of folk. It's a crossover locale others have visited, some making it their musical home. Schogen should certainly make it his residence since he is clearly at home in this neighbourhood. The end result is a pleasing CD, an effort worth lending an ear to, just maybe regularly.\" \r\n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Jul 27, 2011) \r\n\r\n\"Kyler Schogen headlined the evening, (Springtime in Alberta Festival, Hayloft Acres). The band played an original set and captivated the crowd with thought provoking lyrics and hooky melodies from their new CD, \"Pocket Fulla Nothin'\". They rose above an evening chorus of mosquitoes and frogs to wow an appreciative audience. \"\r\n- Karen Pedlar, Smoky Lake Signal (May 25, 2011) \r\n\r\n\"(Review of \"Electric Life\" - Kyler Schogen, SunCave Records. Released March 1/ 2009.) Schogen is actually a veteran blues man, having recorded several CDs since the mid-1990s with his own band. The music is that sort of good-timing blues which gets the toes tapping. The music has the sad side of life lyrics, but the music suggests tossing the negativity and having some fun. Schogen does a good job of offering up that take on things. A fun blues CD disk for a summer drive.\"                \r\n- Calvin Daniels, Yorkton This Week (Sep 01, 2010) \r\n\r\n\"Starlight Dreams is a well-composed collection of songs that will certainly take the listener on a journey as it fuses a bluesy approach with Spanish and Latin sounding melodies.�\r\n- Alan Kausy, Smoky Lake Signal (Aug 26, 2015)\r\n",

It brings up insecurities, values, expectations, conditioning, suppressed emotions, memories etc. Many tools work similarly, but, as a musician, songwriting and music production are my preferred methods. My album is a manifestation of my inner process and the drop of inspiration that I hope will ripple from my inner being, out through my music, into my behaviour, through my interactions and out into my community. \r\n\r\nThe profound influence parents have on their children during their cognitive development has illuminated my understanding of how we influence everyone around us and how we are constantly shaped by our relationships and social interactions. As a privileged, educated, young woman I feel a personal responsibility to critically self-reflect and become conscious of the ways in which I interact with and influence others.\r\nI am not a mother, but I am an artist, and I know that art�in my case music�has tremendous power to emotionally touch, inspire and affect others. It is a community builder and a powerful language. I use this language to communicate my truth, attract like-minded individuals, deeply and intimately connect with myself and others, and thereby build community.\r\nI want to live in a healthy community with a healthy culture where individuals are free to be themselves, where people's experience and expression are validated and pursuing self-actualization feels safe and supported. I have set out to seed such a community through music: through creative collaboration and through personal as well as interpersonal shadow-work. By recording my music, which reflects my values and my vision, I am planting a seed for a collaborative community around me. I feel pregnant with a culture, and I am motherly committed to nurturing it and bringing it into this world.\r\n\r\nMy songs are inspired by my own experience and the core messages are often about truely looking at our values. I express my own values such as care for the environment, family, love and gratitude for all the mothers and lifegvers, and I sometimes make little social commentaries about the society we live in, yet all with a flowy, dancy feel. \r\n\r\nI play my live sets with a violinist, another gutar player and a beatboxer. The sound is simillar to the album but has a slightly folkyer vibe. \r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nBarbora Ravensdaughter\r\n",

Three months after graduating high-school, the teen left home on a solo adventure to the other side of the world in pursuit of experiences and knowledge.\r\n\r\nLiving a secure and easy life under the wing of his parents was something Sam did not approve of. Perhaps it was the fact that he was born an only child, but his craving for independence led him to live a life against the grain of social norms. Instead of celebrating his 18th birthday with an extravagant party, he chose to run around signing forms and taking photos to finalise his passport. Or when faced with the task of paying rent, he went busking 6 hours a day, 7 days a week in subway stations instead of relying on an employer.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling from east to west in Canada, Sam has found his home in Vancouver. The city's focus on social and mental consciousness has been swallowed in large gulps and transformed into inspiration for him to write many songs, namely so, 'Just Breathe'. A catalogue of other songs are also at a ready to record state. \r\n\r\nDue to his motivated demeanor and eagerness to shake every hand, Sam has been presented with many opportunities and received plenty of support from the good friends he has made in the local Vancouver music scene. Experiencing this camaraderie has taught him that accepting help is okay, as long as you are working hard enough to deserve it.\r\n",

Okayplayer dubbed her a mix of Billie Holiday and Portishead, adding that she’s a \"dynamic singer with an obvious foundation in soul”. After leaving her first record-contract with The Hastings set due to creative differences, Sophia went back to school to enhance her skills as a producer and sound engineer so she could have more control over her creative process and further explore her artistry.  With a new found sense of empowerment as an independent artist, Sophia has created a new record in which the raw beauty of her voice takes centre stage. \r\n\r\nHer debut album, Love Royale, set to be released in February 2016, is an evocative collection of songs intended to take the listener on an introspective journey.  Sophia has spent the last two years honing her production skills, and collaborating with a variety of artists and producers such as Grammy award winning, Jon Brown (Meghan Trainor, Pink) and Vancouver's own, Matt Brevner. Inspired by Brown's LA studio, built inside one of Marilyn Monroe's early homes, Sophia's newly released single and music video, Daytime Dreaming, has an essence of old hollywood glamour. With its compelling arrangement of music and lyrics, Daytime Dreaming tells a story of longing for something more.\r\n\r\nWith the release of her first EP, Wishing Well, 2013 was a breakthrough year for Sophia. Wishing Well was produced by grammy award winner Chin Injeti, and featured Talib Kwali, Shad and DJ Khalil. Her song, \"Higher Baby\", was licensed to Appleton Rum for a nation wide advertising campaign, and she garnered two Juno nominations for her work with Madchild, and rising stars SonReal and Rich Kidd. Sophia, a dynamic performer, has shared the stage with Aloe Blacc, Quadron, and De La Soul. Other notable performances include last year's Manifesto Festival in Dundas Square Toronto, and the 102nd Grey Cup Festival in Vancouver.\r\n\r\nSophia, always evolving in her artistry, is a talent to watch for. Look out for her touring across Canada and the U.S. in support of Love Royale.\t\r\n\"If you can imagine a perfect balance between the sass of the Spice Girls and the depth of Aretha Franklin, it would be Sophia Danai.

While jamming on the beach, singer/guitarists Zach Cornfield and Damon Hanly lamented the fact that there was nowhere in their city to go to listen to the old-school reggae hits they so enjoyed playing. After pondering on this for a brief moment, the obvious solution to this simple problem became apparent: start a reggae band! A couple of weeks later, the curly-haired duo did just that, and recruited bassist Leo Bell and drummer Mike Ramos to complete the lineup. After a successful outdoor gig at The Libra Room during Car Free Days on Commercial Drive, the band went on to secure a monthly gig at the local East Van music hotspot. The band has since played the Make Music Festival in Vancouver, and has also brought their irie vibes to shows in Squamish and Whistler. Reggaelution also recently played to their largest crowd yet at the Vancouver Art Gallery for the Cannabis Day rally. Playing everything from Desmond Dekker to Barrington Levy, Bob Marley to Jacob Miller, Burning Spear to Gregory Isaacs, the band focuses on bringing that laid back roots reggae sound to their live shows, which inevitably end up with people dancing on their feet, or at the very least, grooving in their seats.

Sub Theory is much more than a collection of beats; it is a musical project that reflects the culmination of almost a decade’s worth touring and performing. Laying his hands on production and live performance, Sub Theory brings together a potent mix of Bass dub, and ethnic fusion in to his sets.\r\n\r\nTo his ever-expanding fanbase, Sub Theory is much more than a DJ or producer; he is a master crafter of the collective experience, a shaman of spiritual escape found by following the beats. The journey continues; turning 34 this year, Sub Theory has only scratched the surface of himself as an artist and a person. Resonating on a deeper level, this is Sub Theory’s spirit shining through the haze, breaking through the foggy veil of singularity to find the human connection.",

I'd love to be able to lay down a beat and a bass groove, and then just rock out with some other peeps all on our own various instruments. If you guys have a drumset there too, that would be phenomenal (I've been playing the drums for 10+ years) - though I'd need to practice here in Vancouver first in order to integrate it into my live show. \r\n\r\nAs far as requirements go, I don't really have any... Ideally you guys would be able to have an audio interface I could use for my set, since mine is super heavy and I don't have a vehicle... Transportation + a safe place to leave my gear actually might be a reuiqrement? Not sure - I'd have to figure out logistics. \r\n\r\nAn awesome thing to have would be a video feed from the stage so that people watching can see what I'm doing (they can connect the sounds they hear directly to what I do with my various machines!). \r\n\r\nAnyway this is getting pretty long, so I'll end this application now.

I also write and have been working on recording an EP at Pacific Audio Visual Institute. At the moment I have been DJing in Vancouver lots, I have a Sunday spot at the Metropole Pub and spin every two weeks at Whiskey's and Forum. I have to cater to bar fans at those gigs but I'm very very passionate about spinning music that inspires love, peace, creativity and unity. Music is an integral part of my life, it's literally all I do. If I'm not listening to music for other people to jam to I'm listening to music to get me inspired to create. I DJ acid jazz, psychedelic rock and psychedelic music in general, blues, folk, reggae, downtempo, electronica, hip hop, classic rock, neo psychedelia, ambient, and more. I don't limit my musical genres I just mix what sounds good and gets the crowd dancing and shouting with love. I also am a hip hop artist with lots of finished songs I could incorporate into my DJ set, my lyrics are about consciousness and life and energy, not the generic rapper lyrics you would think of when you hear Hip Hop. This is Hip Hop from the mind, body and soul. Music at it's purest. You can check out two of my tracks at www.soundcloud.com/originofspin . Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon! Much love and respect, peace! ",

From David Suzuki's Blue Dot Tour at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver, to the Uplift Festival & Woodford Festival in Australia, I have humbly shared stages and panels with artists like Feist, The Barenaked Ladies, David Suzuki, Trevor Hall, Hey Ocean, Natalie Rize, Nahko Bear, and Neil Young, in the hopes of spreading a message of hope and action. \r\n\r\nI am proud to stay connected to where I call home, and I feel blessed to be a part of a musical community that includes sharing stages and collaborating with other lower-mainland Coast-Salish performers including Buckman Coe, Erin Sage & Warless, Emily Molloy, Will Ross, Leah Barley, and Sliammon Nation artist & activist Ta'Kaiya Blaney. Ta'Kaiya and I just completed a month-long speaking and music tour in Australia, and I look forward to more opportunities where I can make music & share the message of using our voice to speak up for the rights of the land and the people.\r\n\r\nMaking music with my sister, who travels with me as my only bandmate, is an especially magic experience - she mirrors me so intuitively. Her subtle & intelligent musicianship compliments my raw dynamic energy, and to do what you love with your family is an incredible gift that I adore sharing with the world. \r\n\r\nI'm currently on tour across Canada (hello from Thunder Bay, Ontario!).

His dimension-shattering innovational sounds are unparalleled from dolphins, whales, birds and ufo’s, to all-encompassing “walls of sound”. From trance like, water dripping, rainbow portal inspired songs of ascension, to thunderous cell penetrating sonic sound healing to the most delicate harmonics or lightning fast licks, he is the full package. Grammy nominee and Independent music winner, who has been featured on MTV’s Real World, Fusion TV in Mexico, National Public Radio, Wisdom Radio, Burning Man Festival and have been on major world tours as opening act from Sarah McLaclan, Joe Satriani, Chicago, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne and many others. Using crystals, stones, lasers, violin bow, meteorites, ankle bells and more, this explosive and eternally spontaneous musician puts on a stellar show that one never forgets and the inspiration that the crowd feeds on is overflowing. Playing the guitar with a love filled joy tuned to an ancient frequency, leaves one’s senses coated in fractals, harmonics, and DNA-upgrading sounds of color, cradled in the arms of rebirth, transformation and bliss. He is a very passionate, dynamically rhythmic, instrumental, one man band performer, developing complex and very energetic world tribal progressions on his alternately tuned guitar. His creative guitar sound can easily fill huge venues. He is truly a show stopper that leave audiences wanting more. As author, poet, musician, sound healer and truly an inventor of unique sounds, Scott continues to penetrate the uncharted territories of sonic reality, through his intuitive constancy of ever innovative techniques.

With over 70 shows and 8 music festivals in the past year alone, we are starting to capture the attention of a global audience. We've have played several shows in the Southern California region and toured in the US, Spain and Mexico.\r\n\r\nNot only do we spend countless hours refining our mixing skills, but we also produce our own tracks. With an ear for the music, the transition into production was natural. We have already released 6 original tracks and 2 remixes in our first year of producing, 3 of which were signed to record labels (MalLabel Music, Helitricity Records, Sheppard Records).  Our first Beatport release in January 2017, 'Hot Boi' charted in the Top 100 Indie Dance/Nu Disco Releases, reaching spot #4. We are currently producing our first album :) \r\n\r\nOur music can be described as bouncy, 4 to the floor beats, characterized by pretty melodies and deep, wobbly, rolling basslines; heavily influenced by hip hop and the underground bass house music scene. The love and passion we have for our craft and for each other is undeniable and transcends everything we do! Specializing in Wobble House, G House, Tech House, and Brazilian Bass.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I have a varied and eclectic taste in music colored by my experiences and the cities I've lived in over the years - Toronto, Melbourne, Berlin, and now Victoria (my current home).  I like to share with the listener or dancer something they might not have heard before, or put something in a new context.   I like to play multi-genre sets that take people on a journey.  Deep, hypnotic, warm and soulful are vibes I like to share.  I prefer daytime/evening/warm-up time-slots.\r\n\r\nMy sounds usually involve dub/reggae/world/jazz often crossed with house, techno, bass, and ambient/chill.   At the moment I'm really into the digital/bass folklore sounds of (or inspired by) South America.\r\n\r\nMy DJ name is Soulsystem.\r\n\r\nMy friend Pyrrha (Sarah) Luna recommended I apply to your event :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nGeorg",

[from my Mixcloud bio]\r\n\r\nEver since attending and volunteering at Blessed Coast last year I've wanted to play a set there.  So I just did a little mix inspired by the thought of playing at this year's event.  I was actually imagining the set in the late morning or early afternoon before the regular programing begins.   (If I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember the music only starting in the afternoon at some point..?).   Anyway, I'll leave that up to you ;-)  The mix is called Innaspace (ie.

Her collage of lyrical rap flow and smooth vocal melodies over criss-crossing genres has earned her a loyal tribe and expanding fan base. Lozen exudes an energy that is both raw and authentic. Live shows have evolved her unique approach to Hip Hop while recordings have pushed her sound across the globe.\r\n\r\nLozen's success sparked when she teamed up with Bombastic Jam Label boss and funk producer Basement Freaks (Hamburg, Germany). Bootyfunk (2011) garnered a significant amount of online press, reaching No#3 on junodownload.com and racked up hundreds of thousands of plays on\r\nsoundcloud.com with the overwhelming public response received from the \"Records in the Crate\" single remix competition. Lozen was able to keep the momentum going with Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON) releasing Tragedy & Triumph Mixtape (2012) which ranked No#10 on the National Hip Hop Charts.\r\n\r\nAfter opening for roster of heavyweights including De La Soul, Blackalicious, The Beatnuts, Masta Ace and Swollen Members it was time to hit the road. Touring with Kyprios and Animal Nation fueled the fire and the next collaborative project was born. Shake It Up (2014) was produced by Animal Nation and released via Urbnet Records (Toronto, ON), reaching No#6 on the National Hip Hop Charts and No#37 on CMJ USA Top 40 Hip Hop.\r\n\r\nWith a number of successful releases under her belt, headhunters have begun noticing Lozen’s refreshingly dynamic style. After spending several years refining her craft, this self-professed lyrical warrior has undoubtedly matured into an innovative new-school leader. Performing at world-renowned festivals; Envision 2015 (Uvita, Costa Rica), Shambhala Music Festival 2013 & 2010 (Nelson, BC) Lozen is quickly becoming a household name. Now achieving notable emcee status, add DJ and guitarist to the mix. Lozen's on the fly off the cuff spirit shines through when performing on stage. She has a way of connecting with her audience by bringing people together. The credo: Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons you can’t take your eyes off her is your ears. Soulful, yet gritty. Lighthearted, yet deep. Her work ethic and passion has earned her residency at nightclubs and radio shows, reaffirming why she remains a buzzworthy artist who grabs your attention.

Choosing to abandon laptop-based production, the duo create and perform their material using samplers, live instruments and an arsenal of vintage gear, analog tape effects, spring verbs and dusty old tubes. The result? A unique sound that bridges earth and wire – a place where electricity meets and dances with the naked, human body.",

Cam is currently living in his van which he has converted into a make-shift recording studio, and has been actively supporting the decentralization movement in Vancouver.\n\nHe jokingly refers to himself as \"solarpunk� for having futuristic gadgets, solar panels, wires and knobs housed in the shell of his 1981 V8 chevy funcraft. Believing music should transcend meaning into other mediums of communication, he is inspired by philosophy, technology, community, and sustainability, believing they're all integrated in one system.\n\nAmble Greene tries to tweak the traditional model of what's expected of an act. Sure there's showmanship, entertainment, but there's also innovation, forward thinking and most importantly an intimate connection.\n\nCam has also begun construction on a tiny house that he's building on a trailer. One day he hopes to live in this house and be able to record his own music at will. Ideally he would like to live sustainably, grow his own food and continue to explore this infinite world and its endless mysteries. \n\nHis end goal as an artist would be to inspire people to live differently and to become more conscious of the socio-economic problems that face our uncertain future.",

        "bio": "I am performing live painting, not on canvas, but rather on a person, a Devin nude body, and using henna as my medium - natural body art (temporary tattoos). \r\n\r\nThis live painting installation would start at sunrise near a music stage and end at sunset (to mimic the time of fasting for Muslims during the sacred month of Ramadan). I would cover the Devin body with traditional Arabic henna motifs prominent in Muslim culture and used for religious holidays and sacred unions such as weddings. And when the henna has dried and crumbled off, the skin will be stained with the motifs and will remain stained for several days.   \r\n\r\nThe concept of this live body painting installation is to intentionally juxtapose the two worlds that I come from - My Moroccan heritage, an Arabic culture which relies heavily on its conservative religious customs, and my French Canadian heritage - a very liberal, open-minded and free spirited realm. My questions in this installation are - What is sacred? What is forbidden? And why? What is the meaning of sacred? Where are the limits of beauty, divinity and blasphemy? And so I draw from these questions as I make my own lines from my heritage on a Devin nude body for all to see. \r\n\r\nI see divinity as a presence that is always there, and is either blocked and hidden or shining and flowing on to share and touch others. In this installation, the concept of staining skin for several days gives life and longevity to the art, as it will remain a shine and persist when I, the artist, has stopped \"painting�. Its is a moving installation, living, breathing, dancing, and ever changing, as the tint will fade after several days, and as the Devin body tans, sweats or freckles from the sun. \r\n\r\nThis is an original instillation, so I don't have a website showcasing my work, but I have attached my Pinterest page where I draw my inspiration of henna designs.

It will already be at Astral Harvest and Revelation this year, and still confirming details with Zion Noiz and What The Festival but it should be making rounds there too!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.luna-artanddesign.com/spirit-guides.html\r\n\r\n\r\nArt Exposition;\r\nI would love to bring in my 2D work to expose, some of it is blacklight reactive, and I have prints, leggings and scarves that I would like to vend on which I would be open to working out a commission rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoop Performances;\r\nI can perform during DJ sets, I have an LED smart hoop for night-time performances. I have previously performed at Shambhala, Cascadia NW, and Elysium, and have Astral Harvest confirmed for this year as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso open to potentially teaching hula hoop workshops!\r\n\r\nArtist Biography;\r\nLuna was barely five when her parents conveyed the concept of a \"job\" to her, and right then and there the answer already was \"an artist!\" Not many can say they've fulfilled their childhood dreams. In high school, she took art IB, did a two year pre-university program in visual arts and completed up to her second year at Emily Carr University before realizing that school wasn't for her. It was at this point in time that she set off on a journey with no other purpose than to experience, and it was then that she met her greatest of teachers, Mother Earth herself. Constantly inspired by the frantic, changing world by which she surrounds herself, Luna is always striving to create in new ways, new mediums, to share ideas and expand thoughts. To make you analyze the very fabric of life from another perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking my creations into consideration for exposition at Blessed Coast! I would just like to add that my boyfriend has also applied to perform as a musician (Chrizpy Chriz/Chris Gouchie) which means that I would not require any travel coverage if he were to make it in as well (and, since I know you are small budget, I would actually be completely open to doing it only for sale profits on my artwork, since if he is in, I would be there either way!). I look forward to hearing back!\r\n\r\nMuch Love,\r\nLuna ",

Branch’s third full-length release is a concept album that shines with musical performances by the Halfway Tree reggae band. Studio One reggae pioneer Brian “Bassie” Atkinson delivers deep, undulating bass lines, while the brass section glistens on this collection of authentic roots reggae music. Named after the bustling music district in Kingston, where Andru has performed (Reggae Sunsplash 1998, Sting 2001, Rebel Salute 2012) and recorded with many of Jamaica’s greatest reggae legends (Gramps Morgan, Tony Rebel, Queen Ifrica, Gregory Isaacs, Frankie Paul, Yellowman, Sean Paul, Vybz Kartel), Andru Branch & Halfway Tree continue to inspire fans around the globe, promoting equal rights and social justice. Their music is gloriously hypnotic and their message is positively uplifting. Canada’s music authority Exclaim! Magazine calls it “nothing less than stunning”.",

Being raised in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, and living in his current home base on the isle of Kaua’i, in the Hawaiian island chain, the beauty of nature is ever present in the songs, providing a template for stories of adventure, growing pains, and deep reverence for the Land. In the music is the story of all lives, an honest grounding and a ruthless determination to transcend. Sedalia infuses with his live performance, a firm and compassionate call for environmental justice action and support, and creates a dynamic, interactive conversation through crowd involvement in the performance. Playing alongside artists such as Nahko & Medicine for the People, Xavier Rudd, and Tubby Love, Sedalia's music helps to push along the greater conscious music movement. Layered with ancient symbolism created by close contact with the flesh of the earth, along with the cultivation of the traveler’s wide eyes, the songs share the gift of unflinching compassion.\"\r\n\r\n\"In addition to being touring musicians, Sedalia and friends are organic farmers in Hawaii. Infused in the music is their love for the land and a call for a healthy relationship with the land through directly inspiring listeners into a feeling of reverence for nature.

I will make a welcome sign at the entrance to help people get to know this 4,000 year old practice that is found around the world in many different rituals and religions. The labyrinth will be set up and open all weekend (lines created with fabric layed out, maybe small stones, contained candles at night etc.) which I am willing to steward, monitor and maintain. I am also called to offer one/two time slots where the bowls will be set up and people can sit with me (in small group or one-on-one) before they walk to explore the different ways to Find deep purpose or intention in this dynamic meditation. This will be by signup or walk in (which ever suites the space/time best). When people are ready to enter the labyrinth with their new found intention and way of walking, I will play the Crystal Choir (crystal bowls, lyre, chimes etc) to allow for deep openings through the SoundSeed Medicine as they walk to centre and back out again. \r\nEither an installation for the entire weekend if we find an appropriate space, or at the main stage at sunset one night and i will create it for the use of 1.5/2hrs with candles, fabrics and offer a short description and play and invite people to walk for the duration of that time then take it down again. \r\n\r\nDescription: This mystical ritual, thousands of years old, is a metaphor or one's journey to the centre of understanding. The Labyrith is a sacred space, like the medicine wheel, and a universal symbol of peace. It is a pattern with purpose, an ancient tool that speaks to a long forgotten part of us. Lying dormant for centuries, labyrinths are undergoing a revival for use and interest. They offer a chance to take 'time out' from our busy lives, to leave schedules and stress behind. Walking its path is a gift we give to ourselves, leading to discovery, insight, peacefulness, happiness and sometimes tears, connectedness, and well being. \r\nThe Labyrith will be set up and open to walk any time all weekend, with ceremonial opening (friday time) and official closing (Sunday evening time). Please join for these specific times as well. There will be opportunity on (Saturday/sunday morning or afternoon -suggested 10am-1pm or 1pm-4pm) to explore 'The Labyrinth Walk: Finding the Sounds of Self.' In this dynamic meditation, Ocian with SoundSeed Medicine Journeys will help participants find intention and way of walking and then play crystal bowls and other instruments while you walk creating a beautiful unique soundscape as you walk the path to centre and back into the world again.

The Dome is too small with not enough air circulation to be holding deep sacred space. As well, I was given a 7pm space and the music was over bearing for a sound journey to take place at the same time. \r\nThe candles will be amazing in the grass there and if possible, I'd love to be set up to the sound system at the stage... \r\n$150 is mostly for installation costs: candles, holders, fabric, signs, string fence. \r\nIf you have another location suggestion that would suite this offering, please connect.\r\n",

The refreshing aspect of her performance is the love and joy she has of live-improvisation and spontaneous crowd participation, her fearlessness and inclusivity draws her audience into the heart of her performances and into to the spirit of the magic she creates.\r\n\r\nThe Māreikura, recognized as female supernatural beings with noble whakapapa, genealogy, are Rita Peihopa of Ngāpuhi & Tiana King of Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairoa, Ngāti Whatua and Te Rarawa.

We would love to be a part of your growing gathering and see what its all about! Below is my career in a nutshell. \r\n\r\nOfficial bio:\r\n\r\n2-time Vancouver Island Music Award winner and WCMA nominee ‘Immaculate’ has pursued his life passion - writing, recording, producing and performing profanity-free hip-hop – for close to 15 years. Although his tastes and styles have evolved, his dedication to creating high quality, meaningful tracks that speak directly to his audience, has never wavered.\r\n\r\nConsistent, creative effort and collaboration has paid off. Immaculate has earned his reputation as a strong live performer having toured across 8 countries with established names including Machine Gun Kelly (MGK), Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Apathy and Celph Titled (the Demigodz) and Zion I and rocking festivals like Center of Gravity, Keloha, Hidden Music Festival, the Groove, YAA fest and the Golden Sound Festival and warming up audiences for numerous established names such as A$AP Rocky, Three 6 Mafia, Xzibit, M.O.P, Masta Ace, Wu-Tang, Souls of Mischief, Bliss n Eso, Warren G, Swollen Members, Shad, Illy, Zion I, Classified, Madchild, Sweatshop Union, DL Incognito, Moka Only, Emotionz, Kyprios, Sonreal, Snak the Ripper, Evil Ebenezer and many more.\r\n\r\nThe critically acclaimed rapper has also developed a solid buzz with the sales of thousands of copies of his 6 solo albums, his music charting on college radio, and winning several songwriting competitions. Immaculate has 6 official music videos one of which earned him a BCIMA nomination for 'Video of the Year'. Other critical recognition came when he was named ‘winner’ for his track ‘Destructive Behavior’ (reaching over 25,000 plays in it's first week) in an International song contest hosted by Life and Death Productions of Finland where he competed against hundreds of entries from around the world. Immaculate won first place in another world-wide collaboration contest for “Who’s the Illest” hosted by Arizona's Cryptic Wisdom and also made it to the finals of both the 2014 and 2015 Unsigned Only competition with over 10,000 submissions from over 100 countries.\r\n\r\nHis sixth independent release ‘Solitude’ highlights a new depth and maturity in his writing and production and features powerful tracks drawing from a recent family tragedy exemplifying the growth of an artist reinventing himself with every song.\r\n\r\nImmaculate has emerged as a significant voice in hip-hop – a voice well worth listening to.\r\n",

Time Nomads is a natural extension of my previous work, Global Nomads, a photo series dedicated to leaving countries better than found. It intends to explore two prominent issues in Canada:cultural identity and mental health. \r\n\r\nThe concept is for festival attendees to:\r\n1. Pick up a blank postcard from the “Open Here” side of the mailbox\r\n2. Capture their elevated and euphoric thoughts and immortalize it in the postcard\r\n3. Include their own mailing addresses\r\n4. Put it in the “Drop Off” slit of the mailbox (locked to secure privacy)\r\n\r\nI will then send out the uplifting messages back to them 6-8 months later when Seasonal Affective Disorder and other mental illnesses are heightened. Once more, by the time the postcards are mailed back to the attendees, it will be a great reminder to purchase their passes for Blessed Coast Festival 2019! ;) \r\n \r\nWhile the message will serve as an uplifting reminder of sun-kissed joy in the dead of winter, it also holds a deeper meaning. Every year, 1 in 5 Canadians experience a mental health or addiction problem, and 10-15% experience mild to clinical forms of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Mental disorders and substance abuse often go hand in hand, and can affect our thought processes, causing us to focus on our current misery and forget the times we felt great or even normal. Time Nomads is a harm reduction tool that attempts to link our good past experiences to our future mental health.\r\n\r\n",

The “Open Me” side will be unlocked with blank postcards and several markers for festival goers to use, while the “Drop Off” side will be locked with a slit to allow completed postcards to be deposited.

Each painting is accompanied with a written interpretation providing an interactive, experiential process of initiation for the viewer into the mythos of Traditional Tantra. Bhagavan Shanmukha's book, the Divine Initiation is an esoteric de-coding of the vedas, and this collection of paintings is a visual interpretation of that de-coding.

        "bio": "Sarah Wheeler\r\nBiography\r\n\r\n\"One of Vancouver's punchiest indie singers.\"  Fish Griwkowsky, Edmonton Sun\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler is queer artist and recent cancer survivor who is defined by power house vocals and an indomitable positive spirit.  A blazing live performer.  Although she has enjoyed collaborating with other musicians, lending her vocals to recordings such as “A Small Wonder” by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and sharing the stage with artists including Dan Mangan and Tanya Tagaq, this Vancouver-based artist has consistently remained focused on writing and performing her own music.  \r\n\r\nStuart Derdeyn from The Province reviewed Wheeler’s work by saying, “this is a very solid effort from an artist who has always had it but really tapped the right points and doesn't miss here”.\r\n\r\nLife changing experiences inspired Wheeler’s upcoming unreleased album Revival.  Having been diagnosed with cancer and undergone treatment that kept her from performing for a year, Sarah wrote much of what would become her newest album during that time.  Wheeler wrote, performed, produced and recorded all of the songs for Revival, giving it a perspective that is uniquely homemade.  The result is a collection of songs with an unforced honesty and message of positivity through dark times. \r\n\r\nWheeler’s musical heritage was handed down to her through her grandfather’s pioneering efforts as a jazz pianist in local Vancouver clubs during the 50’s and 60’s.  In that period he backed jazz greats including Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr.  Sarah's mother had music in her blood.  She started teaching Sarah to sing before she could walk, and raised her in a household amidst the sounds of classic rock n roll, blues, jazz, and country music. Growing into a seasoned recording artist has been a natural progression for Sarah.  In the present day pop culture climate of false celebrity, Sarah is an old fashioned believer in remembering that the true power of music is the love of it.  \r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler is a third generation Vancouver born Canadian singer/songwriter who has leant her vocals to recordings such as “Don’t You Think We Should Be Closer” by Edmonton's Mark Davis of Old Reliable, and played live with artists including Mike McDonald of Jr. Gone Wild and The Be Good Tanyas.  None of which means anything without something to say.  Wheeler’s new album is a true Revival.\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler has an \"effortlessly big voice which falls somewhere between Chrissie Hynde and Neko Case.\"-Adrian Mack The Georgia Straight\r\n",

Recent revelations have aided me to highlight this important intention for my 2017 festival tour. If I could carry only one message through my art it would be this simple but powerful verse:  “Inspire Love”  To your Neighbor, your friend, your son your daughter , the stranger you shared a smile with!  We all seek and aspire towards a positive epiphany at this particular cross road.     Through live art, self expression is a well loved journey both inwards and outwards!  Ineffable benefits are abound for the artist and beholder! What improv painting unfolds on my canvas further reflects another facet of my inner self.. Perhaps even a cue to the next path on my vision quest.   My past esteemed artworks have held upmost detail to a ethereal theme, and through this artistic style I envision my further transcendence in art.  Baby blue, pink and mint, a splash of black white, rainbow.. 8 years experience, and with each year passing my talent progresses; the best is only yet to come! I am more than excited to offer for 2017 “Inspire Love”  Live art by Rae Vena  \r\n Otherworldly, at first glance, a jumbo flower hangs down, art nestled between its petals.. A round canopy hangs from above, each pastel petal flows gently in the wind revealing its inner artful purpose. Inside, a nest of rugs & pillows surround an intimate exhibit of surreal art . In the center a blossoming live art painting takes host ! My art environment is part installation, part performance -for this is where my live art magic will take home for the weekend. By nightfall the glimmer of lights further invite observers to explore the art locus. Eclipsed by day, luminescent night sky will glow with curiosity on the inside floret. A live art hub,  where you can meet the artist, see the process and of course share space with others in creative conversation. This project is designed & will be handmade using as many up-cycled materials as possible. The top of the canopy is pvc tubing attached to roped pulley system. Pastel fabrics will be cut & sewn into the petals, then fitted with a bottom casing for water resistance. This canopy is decorative as well as useful for protection against rain, or simply roping off the art & displaying a \"closed\" sign during off hours for dancing! The essential benefit of hosting a space throughout the weekend is that guests can periodically visit to see an ongoing live art exhibit. Plans include fabricating a lock box for paints & tools of my trade & create a secure free standing wall from repurposed materials. If my timeline and costs doesn't permit the build of these extra elements, a heavy based easel will be secured  & a patio umbrella used as a base for my live painting. My installation is best suited under a tree to easily hang the canopy from above, if necessary a free standing method can be implemented with the patio base. I suggest distance of 30 meters or less to available electricity, and placement within earshot of a stage for musical inspiration! Thank you for joining me in celebrating my dedication in creation, for this unique festival exhibit  ~ Inspire Love , Blessed Coast 2017! ",

I'll start off by telling you a little bit about my musical journey. \r\n\r\nI started playing classical piano from a young age and eventually fell in love with the instrument. I was then pulled into improvisation and jazz, and soon enough I began composing electronic bass music. I am now dedicating all my energy towards a music career and have just begun a jazz piano degree at Grant Macewan University. My vision is to combine the powerful sounds of electronic music with live piano into a combination which elates the dance-floor and inspires humanity.\r\n\r\nOver the last year, I have made many moves to advance my career. I released my first album titled 'The Vault' on December 2015, and have since released an EP titled 'Primal Waking' which features my best music yet (https://soundcloud.com/pauermusic/sets/primal-waking-ep). I played for the closing ceremonies at Astral Harvest last summer, so I have experience playing at festivals (link: music starts at 05:30 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FLB4or938&t=564s). I am a competent pianist and am constantly practicing to become the most well-rounded musician I can be (you can check out my instagram for piano clips: https://www.instagram.com/pauermusic).\r\n\r\nMy music could be described as deep rhythmic bass mid-tempo with strong chord progressions and ethereal soundscapes. The set I would throw at your festival would have 'thick midtempo vibes' most likely suited for night-time. Like I said, I am currently dedicating all of my energy towards becoming the best musician I can be, and I genuinely believe that my performance would bring something really special to this festival.",

Erothyme produces spacious bass-infused downtempo, using a combination of digital synthesis and recorded sounds from nature. Little Star weaves multidimensional hymns through live vocal looping. In their collaborative performance, live-looped vocals and keyboard melodies dance upon a foundation of heartfully crafted beats and celestial soundscapes, merging the pristine intricacy of well-produced electronic music with the spontaneity and organic warmth of live instrumentation. Their music invokes a sense of the mythic and timeless, revealing the deeper harmony that exists between seemingly separate mediums.\r\n",
